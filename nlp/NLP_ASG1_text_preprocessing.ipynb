              "\"The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . `` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . Wards protected The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . ( 2 ) Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . His petition charged mental cruelty . The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin . Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . The petition listed the mayor's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. . The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. Aj . Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney . Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1 . He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday . Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign . Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Construction bonds Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work . A revolving fund The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin . The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . Colquitt -- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' . The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402 . Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . `` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said . `` Being at the polls was just like being at church . I didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' . The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . `` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` There wasn't a bit of trouble '' . Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Austin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . One validated acts of school districts . Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed . One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . Austin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . Austin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . `` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts '' . Austin , Texas -- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . `` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover . College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . Paris , Texas ( sp. ) -- The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president . Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma . He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A & I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla. . In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology . During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College . He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army . Denton , Texas ( sp. ) -- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . `` Must solve problem '' The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . `` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ? `` Yes , your honor '' , replied Bellows . `` What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . There is a conflict among the defendants '' . Washington , July 24 -- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio . The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone . Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion . Decisions are made Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' . Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city . The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' . Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases . In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' . Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutor . Issue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury . Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation . Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning . Karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' . He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the Criminal court processes . `` Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court . Faced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons . Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another . The cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward . The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns . Two other cases also were under advisement . Claims precedent lacking After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them . Washington , Feb. 9 -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill . It was defeated in Congress last year . Cost up to $37 a year It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . Outlays would increase Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . Both figures would go higher in later years . Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . Nursing home care The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 2 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 3 Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . 4 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . Calls proposal modest He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . `` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . `` This is not a program of socialized medicine . It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . Wouldn't pay doctors The plan does not cover doctor bills . They would still be paid by the patient . Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . Contributions to schools The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . More for nursing homes In the area of `` community health services '' , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . Asks research funds The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . He did not say by how much . For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . Reaction as expected Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan . Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the House . Washington , Feb. 9 -- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . Enforce by demand The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 . Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . Exploratory mood A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited . The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters . The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . Conflict surveyed The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . This increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . Washington The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos . The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this . The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated . But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . Policies modified The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference . This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union . He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . GOP restrained It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it . They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba . One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score . His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination . Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators . Detente urged This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' . It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation . But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated . Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors . Aid plans revamped Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . But thus far there has been no response in kind . Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture . Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos . But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate . And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos . But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos . ( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however . ) There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam . The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos . The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army . There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt . If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna . Washington The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States . The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . Offenses multiply The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . East Providence now has no civil defense program . Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . He is not interested in being named a full-time director . Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . Mr. Hawksley said . One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station . He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area . Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point . Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly . The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls . A copy was released to the press . Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant . The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said . `` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , Mr. Notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' . The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws . The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath . The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday . The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday '' , the council's resolution said . The small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday . They `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' . That , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . `` That was before I studied law . Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. . The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post . Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . `` After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . `` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' . He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . `` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September . Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system . Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting . Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance . At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition . Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . `` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? He asked . The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . `` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark . Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' . Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . `` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , Mitchell said . Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . `` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , Jones said . The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . Defends Ike Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : `` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . `` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . `` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' . Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . `` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . That failed . `` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . That , too , will fail '' . Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 . Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner . Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals . `` My experience as public safety commissioner '' , Roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . Jim Sheeran fits that description '' . Trenton -- William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service . A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section . Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education . Boonton -- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' . He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : `` When I come back here after the November election you'll think , ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' . He said , `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time '' . Attacks Republicans In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . But we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . `` We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November '' . He said , `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' . He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy '' . He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . `` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean '' , the former Superior Court judge said . `` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s '' . Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people '' , Hughes asked , `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November '' . Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's `` Green Acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday . Conservation plan The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state . The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . Hughes said , `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it '' , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve '' . Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved . He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans . `` After the primary '' , he promised , `` I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee '' . Trenton -- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters . A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment . She served one four-year term on the national committee . Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . Opposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader . Mayor visits Buckley As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader . He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor . Screvane and Beame hailed The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller . The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx . After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York Times . The Mayor said : `` It didn't come from me . But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates '' . Boston , June 16 -- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . `` It's ' See Joe , see Jim ' '' , he says . `` The hand is out '' . A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , `` The Last Hurrah '' . But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations . And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . Day after day some new episode is reported . The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . Washington , June 18 -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee . It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor . Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday . Leadership is hopeful The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy . They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts . Three groups to meet What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 . This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee . About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview . Six of these were proposed by religious groups . They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . Question raised Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . When he protested , the hotel owner said : `` Why do you worry ? ? The U. S. Government is paying for it . The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' . Missionary explains `` I don't work for the Government '' , the American said . `` I'm a missionary '' . The hotel owner shrugged . `` Same thing '' , he said . And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . Moscow , June 18 -- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : `` Look , he took everything I had '' ! ! Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker . Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid . The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates . This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 . In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries . United Nations , N. Y. , June 18 -- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations . This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations . One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India . India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations . Formula is due this week The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week . The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start . Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point . Geneva , June 18 -- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces . The latter two are half-brothers . Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos . An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded . But no one was overly optimistic . Tactics studied in Geneva W. Averell Harriman of the United States , Malcolm MacDonald of Britain , Maurice Couve De Murville , France's Foreign Minister , and Howard C. Green , Canada's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week . Princess Moune , Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter , read the Princes' statement . They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she said . The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days . To deal with principles The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government . Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill. . Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . They reside at 4911 Miles Dr. . Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . Many buildings Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . Seats on square Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House . In this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans . Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units . About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . Division one of the parade will be the service academies . Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson . Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union . Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states . Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa , the trust territories and the Canal Zone . Jackson , Miss. -- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ? Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett . Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year . Could be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session . The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . Districts issue Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature . Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House . Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . Future clouded Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election . Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . Baton Rouge , La. -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . Legislators weary Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes . Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy . If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature . Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . Underlying concern Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition . He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . Constant problem In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature . This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract . The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . Concern bankrupt The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d St. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law . On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr. . Intervenes in case The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms . Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co. . At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . `` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , Berger said . The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track . The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints . The city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged . Wide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint . The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per joint . But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint . Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference . Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company . `` We won't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , Wagner said . `` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , Berger said . Wagner replied , `` Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172,000 ' '' ? ? ' know enough to sue ' Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El . `` We want to find out who knew about it '' , Pratt said . `` Certain people must have known about it '' . `` The PTC is investigating the whole matter '' , Pratt said . Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year . Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee . For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said . Testifies at hearing His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services . The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that . The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room . The cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 . Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels . Revenue estimated The city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year . The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses . A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs . The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog . Commissioner replies Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care . In reply , Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees . He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites . Backs higher fees City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year . The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said . The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis . Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday , it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car . The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower , Davenport said . Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time . He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning . Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery , 39 . His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation . The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project . The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project . One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 . The tract is bounded by Island Ave. , Dicks Ave. , 61st St. , and Eastwick Ave. . Four parks planned It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores . The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project . The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project . Would bar vehicles The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp. . The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic . It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project . The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development . The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project . Kansas City , Mo. , Feb. 9 ( UPI ) -- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work . Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles . He was in Baptist Memorial hospital . Ignition sets off blast The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work . `` I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway '' , he said . Gladden's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house . The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall . Hood flies over house The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house . The left front wheel landed 100 feet away . Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel . It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter . Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night . The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union . Led fight on teamsters Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 . The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing . A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City , Kas. . The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett . Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee . Both have been active in the association . Ankara , Turkey , Oct. 24 ( AP ) -- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president . An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat . By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government . The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president . Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months . The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned . Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own . Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . He is married and the father of three children . Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E. M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . `` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up '' . Martin called for patience on the part of Americans . `` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build '' , he said . By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . Individual help best `` We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient '' , the assistant secretary said . Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost '' . Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack . But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful '' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . `` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster '' , he said . `` Nobody really expects to evacuate . I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand '' , said , `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' . Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' . Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program . The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done . Salem ( AP ) -- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov. Mark Hatfield . Hatfield also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception in the state capitol on Tuesday . His schedule calls for a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club . He will speak to Willamette University Young Republicans Thursday night in Salem . On Friday he will go to Portland for the swearing in of Dean Bryson as Multnomah County Circuit Judge . He will attend a meeting of the Republican State Central Committee Saturday in Portland and see the Washington-Oregon football game . Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session . A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January . Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system . Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools . Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen. Wayne L. Morse , Aj . The dinner is sponsored by organized labor and is scheduled for 7 p.m. . Secretary Goldberg and Sen. Morse will hold a joint press conference at the Roosevelt Hotel at 4:30 p.m. Sunday , Blaine Whipple , executive secretary of the Democratic Party of Oregon , reported Tuesday . Other speakers for the fund-raising dinner include Reps. Edith Green and Al Ullman , Labor Commissioner Norman Nilsen and Mayor Terry Schrunk , all Democrats . Oak Grove ( special ) -- Three positions on the Oak Lodge Water district board of directors have attracted 11 candidates . The election will be Dec. 4 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. . Polls will be in the water office . Incumbent Richard Salter seeks re-election and is opposed by Donald Huffman for the five-year term .

Seeking this two-year term are James Culbertson , Dwight M. Steeves , James C. Piersee , W.M. Sexton and Theodore W. Heitschmidt . A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum . The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible . At the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' . New point added Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : `` The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' . The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- His miracles -- His substitutionary work on the cross -- His bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of God . Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God . His offices are in Springfield , Mo. . Election came on the nominating ballot . Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , `` Breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with `` Breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years . The Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work . `` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life '' , he told delegates Friday . Church loses pace Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' . `` In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches '' , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . `` In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none '' , he said . To step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years . To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . ' church meets change ' `` The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' . A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches . -- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . -- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . -- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial . Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' . Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : `` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out '' . In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . Robinson doubles again In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . Carey Singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row . 15 pounds lighter The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . Seeks `` improved fielding '' The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees . Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest . Duren , Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . Squad cut near Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky. . The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; ; J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast . `` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo , too '' , added Old Scrapiron . `` Then we'd really have someplace to go '' . Bowie , Md. , March 17 -- Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. , Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 8,280 attend races Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Culmone gets first win Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . Cleveland , March 17 ( AP ) -- George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield . Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . San Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here . Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . St. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) -- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today . Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . `` This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . `` So I started practicing on it in spring training . Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . `` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . `` Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . Practice helps you to get your timing down . `` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session . `` If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . Footnotes : In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma . Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . It didn't ; ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University . The Mustangs don't play this week . `` We're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy . `` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' . Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . We needed it and we got it '' . Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon . Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . `` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . `` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory . `` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . `` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . `` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . `` He almost brought it back all the way '' . Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . `` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . `` He'll be out of action all this week . He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . `` He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run '' , Meek explained . `` We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play '' . The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . `` We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . We'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off '' . SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21 . Huddle hearsay -- Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A & M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud . End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions . `` Just our luck '' ! ! Exclaimed Stram . `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . `` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . `` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas , Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A & M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) . A & M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight . They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left . Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout . The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove . Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies . The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . Bingles and bobbles : Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits . It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ . Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage . Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . Dallas , Tex. , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . St. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday . Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans . It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss . The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left . The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard . Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front . A double by Green , Allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth . Ogden , Utah , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . `` I've had it '' , he told a newsman . `` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' . This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited . She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : `` I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances '' . The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes . Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I don't think you want to talk to him . You'll probably get a ball bat on the head . He's mad at the world '' . But Jackie had gone into the station . Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . `` I told him who I was and he was quite cold . But he warmed up after a while . I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . He said he had never talked to Liston '' . Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : `` I can't hit anymore . I can't run . I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . `` Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field . Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road . Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle . This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30-30 . Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy . This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) -- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning . Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter . The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager . Only Bucky Harris , the `` boy-manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . Choice was expected The selection had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . Coach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. . He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year . Show follows ceremonies A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . Flushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . Shea was born in Manhattan . He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . Maris is in line for a big raise . Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280-yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . No margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . So he wound up with a dozen . `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . Stickler for rules `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . `` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . `` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . He had a 16 . Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . Nor were there any rules to save him . If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . This knowledge has come in handy , too . His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . The ball floated downstream . A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . Ruling from on high `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? Asked Palmer of an official . `` No '' , said the official . `` You must play it where it lies '' . `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : `` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season . `` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . `` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . Change in pitchers . Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . After Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium . Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game . Mizell has won both of his starts . Nieman kept in lineup . After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants . `` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said . `` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' . `` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . `` He should be getting back in the groove before long . Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday . Six Bucks over . Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each , Dick Stuart , Don Hoak and Bob Skinner . Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs . Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . `` We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . `` Virdon has been blasting the ball . No plunkers for him '' . Six Bucs over . The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season . On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . In 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 . A year later they were 4-13 . Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer . In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do . `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch . Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory . Benington said , `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . After the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me '' . Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award . Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington . On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 '' . Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich . `` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out . `` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game . Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City . The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday . Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple . St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field . The game opened a busy week for Washington . The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . Happy hitting If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . And that's meant as a boost , not a knock . Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . Their heights , that is . Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie . His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . Labor relations Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . The old man was almost too possessive . Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York . With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far . The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark . Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother , J. Hampton Monroe , and Mrs. Monroe .

Birgit Nilsson will be starred . `` Housed in the new McCormick Place theater , this should prove to be an exciting evening '' , adds Mrs. Sims . The board's last money raising event was a performance by Harry Belafonte -- `` quite off-beat for this group '' , decided some of the members . Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of Winnetka , a new board member , will be chairman of publicity for the benefit . Her husband recently was appointed vice president of the university , bringing them back here from the east . Parichy-Hamm Because of the recent death of the bride's father , Frederick B. Hamm , the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St. Bernadine's church , Forest Park . A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel . Mrs. Hamm will not come from Vero Beach , Fla. , for the wedding . However , Mr. Parichy and his bride will go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip , and will stay in the John G. Beadles' beach house . The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest . Harvey B. Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in marriage .

Later , a bus will carry members to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional tennis matches at 8 p.m. . With loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St. Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears , its director , Helen Tieken Geraghty ( Mrs. Maurice P. Geraghty ) is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International Trade fair . Armed with letters from embassies to ministers of countries , especially those in the near and far east , Mrs. Geraghty `` will beat the bushes for oriental talent '' . `` We ( the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry ) expect to establish closer relations with nations and their cultural activities , and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts '' , explains Mrs. Geraghty . `` For instance , Djakarta , Indonesia , has three groups of dancers interested in coming here . I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus '' ! ! The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa . First , Honolulu Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop . Then Japan , Hong Kong , Manila , India , Pakistan , Damascus , Beirut , and to Rome , London , and Paris `` to look over wonderful talent '' . Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return ; ; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter , Molly , bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night . Molly already has her cotillion gown , and it's fitted , says her mother . Also , invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts club . It won't be a `` tea '' , however , but more of an international folk song festival , with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world . The international theme will be continued with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will give in the Racquet club after the tea . Miss Abra Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day . Burke-Rostagno The Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter , Helen Lambert , and the young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith college . He is Aldo Rostagno , son of the Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in Europe . The Burkes , who now live in Kankakee , are telling friends of the engagement . Miss Burke , a graduate of Miss Hall's school , stayed on in Florence as a career girl . Her fiance , who is with a publishing firm , translates many books from English into Italian . He will be coming here on business in December , when the wedding is to take place in Wayne . Miss Burke will arrive in December also . Here and there A farewell supper Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Sethness Jr. planned Sunday for Italian Consul General and Mrs. Giacomo Profili has been canceled because Mr. Sethness is in Illinois Masonic hospital for surgery . Mrs. William Odell , Mrs. Clinton B. King , John Holabird Jr. , Norman Boothby , and Actress Maureen O'Sullivan will judge the costumes in the grand march at the Affaire Old Towne Bal Masque tomorrow in the Germania club .

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. . The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a `` civilian '' with the Army . Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . The job also covers a number of other items . `` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . `` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . `` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . `` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` No Vacancy '' . No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . And where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? Ah , that is simple . Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . That is where we turn in the good old summertime . The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . Many with pools Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . All for $14 ! ! At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . All for $14 . That made up for the `` best '' motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street . In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken Street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home . The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis . His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body . Boy in fair condition The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . His condition was reported to be fair . Police said the children's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . Cites discrepancies Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . `` I hate to have these things come up again and again '' , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . `` These are the board's minutes . I'll write what you tell me to '' . For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so . State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street . He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance . Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . His condition was said to be , `` fair '' . Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street . Barber summoned He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month . Werner criticized Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December . Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , Mr. Schaefer said . The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations '' on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm . Sent home for rest Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest . Work resumed Wednesday , he said . Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced '' . Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' . Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes . Annapolis , Jan. 7 ( special ) -- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention . The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 . Each had been shot in the back several times with a automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives . Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail . The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court . Younger son calls police Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car . The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio . Two brothers adopted Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs . Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis . The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland's Secretary of State . Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named Attorney General to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals . Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday . Simpkins from Somerset Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child . Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947 . Five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law . Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 . From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates . Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported . Dodge reported the following breakdown : Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house . Convenience held key `` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 '' , Pantas predicted . Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section . Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation . London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . Flashed to Moscow A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . ( In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City ) . In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . All five pleaded innocent . Only Miss Gee asked for bail . Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . Refuses to grant bail `` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . He promptly went to communist East Germany . The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . `` This is Russian money '' , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office . He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . `` Of highest value '' The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . Court cleared Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it . Navy's future involved `` Much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . `` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . Interested in detector The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . Range was a vital detail . Designs of parts were sought . Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . ' had to know peddlers ' `` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , Sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . This , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . `` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' . No comments by U.S. In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana Av. . Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan Av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted . Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart Av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way . Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee . His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck . Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School , 30th Street and South Park Way , and began `` skylarking '' . When 51st Street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor . As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down . Then the youths fled with his money . Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier . She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office . Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 . It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place . The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 . The defendant , William L. Stickney 3 , 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month . Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay Rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president . Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street . At Jenks Street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks . The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie . St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . -- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . Still , I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' . Lives on welfare Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police . He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach . However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial . Charges in doubt Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl . Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . Locked in motel A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . The jury foreman , Mrs. Olive Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence . She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid . The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . The verdict came three hours later . Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . A Sterling Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy . Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs. Mary Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren . Services tomorrow Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne's Catholic Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren . The mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home , 31730 Mound , Warren . Mrs. Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East . Held candle Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . Christine's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; ; Dennis , 6 ; ; Eleanor , 2 ; ; and Bernardine , 1 . `` All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted '' , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon . Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills . A135 donated Neighbor women , such as Mrs. Sidney Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister-in-law , Mrs. Anna Kowalski , 22111 David , East Detroit . Another neighbor , Mrs. Frank C. Smith , 2731 Pall Mall , Sterling Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs . John C. Houghton , president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family . Students help out Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East . He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 , Warren Village Station . Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east . Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski . Funds from dances Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night . `` Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said . There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School , 3505o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine . Expresses thanks Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday . But today he wanted to make a public statement . `` I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family . I wasn't sure there were such people anywhere in the world . I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them '' . An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . Patrolman George Kimmell , of McClellan Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps School , for his assistance in the case . Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk . Gets car number Kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly `` took off at high speed '' , he said , narrowly missing him . Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . Returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive . Given 15 days He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction . The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June . The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today . Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire . Help asked In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its `` friends and neighbors '' for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom . Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home . He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire . A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said . Plea for arms The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana . He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers . He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body . A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown . Heavy support The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam . The minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos . There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated . Havana , April 19 . -- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair . The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio , where the executions took place . Arms plot charged The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels . Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's regime . Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami . McNair , 25 , was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio , about 35 miles from Havana . Report others held At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup . Among them were a number of newsmen , including Henry Raymont , of United Press International , and Robert Berrellez , of Associated Press . So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails . More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests . Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state , few emerge in the West to tell about it . M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF ) -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945 . Today , M. Kegham was in Detroit , en route to join his wife and children in California . Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . `` Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . `` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church . Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation . Urged in 1954 The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . `` From its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said Friday , `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . `` As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . `` There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . Corporate existence `` On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia . `` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education '' . A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street , NE , police said . The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims , 19 , of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir. , Aj . Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole . The other occupants were James Willard Olvey , 18 , of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave. , NE , and Larry Coleman Barnett , 19 , of 704 Hill St. , SE , both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises . The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins '' if negotiations failed . The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights . ' intend to attend ' `` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year '' , the identically worded letters said . The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations . They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate . Downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the Friday mail . However , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend . Gather here The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday . Several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair . Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago . Charles A. Black , COAHR chairman , said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up . He declined to name the three . Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting . Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' . Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '' A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '' Besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead .

A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking into the home of relatives in search of his wife , hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him , police said . Patrolmen J. W. Slate and A. L. Crawford Jr. said they arrested Ronald M. Thomas , of 1671 Nakoma St. , NW , after he assaulted the officers . Police account The officers gave this account : Thomas early Sunday went to the home of his uncle and aunt , Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Thomas , 511 Blanche St. , NW , looking for his wife , Margaret Lou Thomas , 18 , and their 11-month-old baby . The younger Thomas ripped a screen door , breaking the latch , and after an argument struck his uncle with a rock , scratching his face . He also struck his aunt and wife , and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches . When police arrived the man was still violent , Slate said . Attacks officer He attacked one of the officers and was restrained . About five minutes later he jumped up , Slate said , and struck the two policemen again . He was then subdued and placed in the police car to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches received in the melee . Then he attacked the two officers again and was again restrained , Slate related . Slate said he and Crawford received cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn . Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and battery . Two counts of assault on an officer , resisting arrest , disturbance and cursing , police said . A hearing was set for 30 a.m. Tuesday . Mrs. Mary Self , who knows more than any other person about the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over the years , has closed her desk and retired . Over the weekend , Mrs. Self , personnel clerk , was a feted and honored guest of the Atlanta Club , organization of women employes at City Hall . After 18 years in the personnel office , she has taken a disability pension on advice of her doctors . As personnel clerk , she handled thousands of entries , ranging from appointments to jobs , to transfers to other employments , to pensions . `` I have enjoyed it and will feel a bit lost at least for a while '' , she said wistfully Friday . One of the largest crowds in the club's history turned out to pay tribute to Mrs. Self and her service . Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest . The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup , Pierce , Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants , according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist . Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical , heptachlor , over 30,000 acres in Troup , 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties . The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties , over 37,679 acres . The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon . Also being treated are Houston , Bleckley , Tift , Turner and Dodge counties , Blasingame said . The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia , attacking crops , young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom , Blasingame said . The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week . This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway . Students have been using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study . Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest methods to eliminate it . Incidentally , 14th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours . It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue , NE ; ; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street , Aj . Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes , two of them in a fiery crash near Snellville , the State Patrol said Sunday .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . `` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ? Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. . `` My feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him . The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' . Harvey criticized Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday . A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff . `` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this . I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' . Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' . The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G. Huntley was arrested in Phoenix , Ariz. , last week and will be returned to Portland to face charges of assault and robbery , Portland detectives said Friday . Mrs. Lavaughn Huntley is accused of driving the getaway car used in a robbery of the Woodyard Bros.' Grocery , 2825 E. Burnside St. , in April of 1959 .

Secret Grand Jury indictments were returned against the pair last week , Detective Murray Logan reported . The Phoenix arrest culminates more than a year's investigation by Detective William Taylor and other officers . Taylor said Mrs. Huntley and her husband also will be questioned about a series of 15 Portland robberies in spring of 1959 in which the holdup men bound their victims with tape before fleeing . Mrs. Huntley was held on $20,000 bond in Phoenix . She was arrested by Phoenix Police after they received the indictment papers from Portland detectives . A 12-year-old girl , Susan Elaine Smith , 9329 NE Schuyler St. was in serious condition Friday at Bess Kaiser Hospital , victim of a bicycle-auto collision in the Gateway Shopping Center , parking area , Deputy Sheriff W. H. Forsyth reported . Funeral for William Joseph Brett , 1926 NE 50th Ave. , who died Thursday in Portland , will be Monday 1 p.m. at the Riverview Abbey .

The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to the state Supreme Court , it appeared last night . Two members of the Democratic-endorsed majority on the school board said they probably would vote to appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education , which said yesterday that the school committee acted improperly in its appointment of the coordinator , Francis P. Nolan 3rd , the Democratic-endorsed committee chairman , could not be reached for comment . In its ruling , the state Board of Education upheld Dr. Michael F. Walsh , state commissioner of education , who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F. Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual education without first finding that the school superintendent's candidate was not suitable . Supt. Clarence S. Taylor had recommended Roger I. Vermeersch for the post .

On Sept. 6 , the Kretchmer rescued the crew of a trawler they found drifting on a life raft after they had abandoned a sinking ship . In August while stopping in Greenock , Scotland , three members of the crew on liberty rendered first aid to a girl who fell from a train . Local authorities credited the men with saving the girl's life . Birmingham , Ala. -- ( AP ) -- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the `` Freedom Rider '' bus burning trial four weeks ago . U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury . He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala. . Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders . The bus was burned outside Anniston . One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal . A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . Neither was seated on the jury . Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . The judge replaced the juror with an alternate . No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents . At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections . One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time . He was not seated on the jury . The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction . New York -- ( UPI ) -- The New York University Board of Trustees has elected the youngest president in the 130-year history of NYU , it was announced yesterday .

Dr. Hester , also one of the youngest men ever to head a major American university , succeeds Dr. Carroll V. Newsom who resigned last September to join Prentice-Hall Inc. publishing firm . Dr. Hester , of Princeton , N.J. , is a native of Chester , Pa. He joined NYU in September , 1960 . Prior to that he was associated with Long Island University in Brooklyn . Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . `` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . `` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . `` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society . The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield . Buchheister pledged the land would be an `` inviolate '' sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants . Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . This had never been done before . Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile . He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . `` The first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . `` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . It was time to go up myself '' . Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight . Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . `` She flew beautifully '' , said Fiedler . `` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . `` It's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' . John Di Massimo has been elected president of the 1961 Columbus Day Celebration Committee , it was announced yesterday . Other officers are Angelo J. Scampini , vice president , Joseph V. Arata , treasurer , and Fred J. Casassa , secretary . Judge John B. Molinari was named chairman of the executive committee . Elected to the board of directors were : Elios P.

Figone Jr. , Stephen Mana , John Moscone , Calude Perasso , Angelo Petrini , Frank Ratto , and George R. Reilly . Dr. Albert Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale . Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday . In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr. Schweitzer wrote : `` Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . `` They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; otherwise no peace is possible . `` Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency '' . A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service . Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . Glimco a buddy Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti . Another hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview . `` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier '' , Stein said . `` But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll '' . Connection is sought Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex . The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant . Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St. . The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . Lee a witness Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee , director of McCormick Place ; ; Jerome Leavitt , a partner in the Union Liquor company , 3247 S. Kedzie Av. , Dominic Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; and Frank W. Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av. . Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place . Stein's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay . Stein estimated this amount at `` about $1,500 or $1,600 a month '' . A $12,500 payment Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers . Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' union . Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year . All of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt . Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll '' at National Maintenance company . The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av. . The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday . The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . Curtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000 . Lien payments involved Huff's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' . Huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage . Charge lists 3 checks The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the association . The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 . On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av. . There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . Later , Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit card . All bounced . When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police . Bonn , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today . Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share . But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering . `` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas . Cable confirmation '' , it said translated . But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares . After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . But the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . `` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do . But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . First , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . Second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market . Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up . And third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . Foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . The potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito . All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . Now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars . More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman . It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history . The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars . It weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year . A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area . The Murray Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated in Dallas in 1896 . They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's . More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown . Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm . The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899 . The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 . Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala. . Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala. . About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes . The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world . Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment . The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co. . They export also . The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies . In 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment . Presently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year . The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912 . Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga. . The district office here employs about 65 . The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here . The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959 . Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock . The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928 . The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment . The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation . Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people . They export cotton ginning machinery . The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment '' . This includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin . The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the Mississippi Delta . The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here . They make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery . The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas . They've been in Dallas since 1921 . Cotton Belt Gin Service , Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago . They distribute equipment in 11 states . The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting , bearings , etc. . Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy . New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year . Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year . Totaling 3,399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963 . However , compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441 , this March was off 23 per cent . On a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744 . This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier . With the March pickup , dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year . The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter . On the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars . Only three standard models -- Buick , Chrysler , and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county . The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project . Now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship . Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields . More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis . Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T. Owens , national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp. of New York . The 33 honored students are : Mike Trigg , Raymond Arrington , and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams , Janice Whitney , Fil Terral , and Carl David Page of W. H. Adamson ; ; Bill Burke , Tommie Freeman , and Lawrence Paschall of N. R. Crozier Tech. Paulah Thompson , Gerald Kestner , and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest ; ; Arnold Hayes , Mary Ann Shay , and Lloyd Satterfield of Thomas Jefferson ; ; William Cluck , Deloris Carrel Carty , and Edna Earl Eaton of North Dallas ; ; Patricia Ann Neal , Johnny Carruthers , and David McLauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville ; ; David Wolverton , Sharon Flanagan , and James Weaver of W. W. Samuels ; ; William Austin , Gary Hammond , and Ronnie Davis of South Oak Cliff ; ; Bill Eaton , Carolyn Milton , and Ronnie Bert Stone of Sunset ; ; and Charles Potter , Ronnie Moore , and Robert Bailey of Woodrow Wilson . The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration , came under fire in Dallas last week . The Administration's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated Caron S. Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' . He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . ' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . `` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . Danger cited He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike . Sacrifices needed Draper declared , `` As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today . We must justify our heritage . We must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' . He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration , that `` Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' . He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' . While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro , `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere . Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that '' . New York ( AP ) -- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks . Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average . It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages . Some good news Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news . A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month . Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxes . The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87 . Of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined . New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 . Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day . Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday . A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American Marketing Assn. . However , Peterson , president of Bell & Howell , warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' . Creations needed `` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , Peterson said . `` With this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' . The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs . Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas . He cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology . He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market . Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange , effective Tuesday , has been announced by Thomas P. Phelan , president of the exchange . Taylor , president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co. , Beverly Hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925 . Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon , Read & Co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp. . Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to Union . Under the new offering , only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares . Due in 1986 The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures , due June 1 , 1986 , at 100% , and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 , 1991 , at 100% . The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1 , 1966 ; ; $70 by 1971 ; ; $75 by 1976 ; ; $80 by 1981 ; ; $85 by 1986 , and $90 thereafter . New York ( AP ) -- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled . Volume was 1.23 million shares , down from Monday's 1.58 million . Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic Foil . Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained 2-1/2 each . Question -- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8 , 1960 . Something has gone wrong some place . I am getting dividends on only 50 shares . In other words , I am getting only half the dividends I should . Answer -- Write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City , N.J. . That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund . The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things . But it seems that this `` electronic brain '' wasn't `` programmed '' correctly . This resulted in a great number of errors . And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders . I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation . At that time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand . They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days '' . That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts . Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected . Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank . Doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries . He selects queries or general interest to answer . Washington ( AP ) -- Alfred Hayes , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system . Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations , `` there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' . Washington ( UPI ) -- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge . Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect . The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj . `` All these kind of things weaken us '' , Perlman said . Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad . `` The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s '' , he told the hearing . C & O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case . The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B & Aj . Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger . The proposed C & O-B & O railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest . Washington ( AP ) -- The government's short-term borrowing costs rose with Tuesday's weekly offering of Treasury bills . On $1.1 billion of 90-day bills , the average yield was 2.325% . The rate a week ago was 2.295% . Washington , March 11 ( UPI ) . -- `` Consumer uncertain about economic conditions '' . This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center . Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . Increase expected The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference . It disclosed that the builders : Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts . The industry has said 1960 was a poor year . Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 . Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? Leaders of industry The reason , says the Housing Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . Elburn , Ill. -- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . We sold only four pickers all last year '' . Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . `` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . The higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . `` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. . For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . Two of three report gains Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . `` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa . `` This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . Last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; in August of 1960 , he sold seven . Dealers' stocks down With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports . Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president . With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . Net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July . Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling . The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . Such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . `` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the President said . Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S. . The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution . Requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show . In such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law . The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . The Tax Court rejected this view . It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . The Service has not said what its next step will be . Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled . The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances . Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage . She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . State briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area . Colorado has a 2% sales tax . Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax . The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent . The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales . The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities . Washington -- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported . The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion . April sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) . The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March . Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March . Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion . Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It's unlike me '' . In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . A favorite is Norman Norell , however . She likes his classic chemise . Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell , a black and white organdy and silk jersey . Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette . She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose . Balenciaga is her favorite European designer . `` I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress '' , she reminisces . `` I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion '' . Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens . Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent , Greer Garson was born in County Down , Ireland . Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles . Reared in England , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London . She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm . Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End . Among stage performances was a starring role in `` Golden Arrow '' directed by Noel Coward . It was during `` Old Music '' at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B. Mayer spotted her . After signing a motion-picture contract , she came to America and had `` Goodbye , Mr. Chips '' as her first assignment after a year's wait . Other triumphs include `` Random Harvest '' , `` Madame Curie '' , `` Pride and Prejudice '' , `` The Forsythe Saga '' and `` Mrs. Miniver '' ( which won her the Academy Award in 1943 ) . Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless . Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in `` Sunrise at Campobello '' . She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` Captain Brassbound's Conversion '' to `` Camille '' . She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London , a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states . She is adept at skeet shooting , trout fishing , Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology . She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts . She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations . Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico . Back in college , today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food . The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy . Last October he gave a public speech in Washington , D.C. entitled `` Are Women Here To Stay '' ? ? So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey , director of SMU's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef . He is apt to rear back and claim his rights . Ramsey , as SMU's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week . Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! ! He also dishes up 3,000 snacks . And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center , along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables . Ramsey , 6-3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says , `` I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook '' . He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to Aj . And you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line . What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ? `` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat '' , says Ramsey . So he hides the mayonnaise . And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments . What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ? `` Pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza '' , says the handsome food expert . `` Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' . Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman , Henry Cabot Lodge , the King of Morocco , Clement Atlee and other shiny characters . Once four Tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line . `` They aren't supposed to look at women , you know '' , Ramsey recalled . `` What with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard time '' . Chicken Cadillac Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest . Salt and pepper each breast . Dip in melted butter and roll in flour . Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan . Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown . Add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts . Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer . While this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter . Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts . Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes . ( Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac , says Ramsey . ) Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month . Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia . A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . The other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . Colorful , bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite . The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group , Composite . The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor . To bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage . Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile . The Vagabonds are `` on the road '' again . Members are on their way to Saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars . This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club , Saledo , for festivities . Invitations have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price Daniel . Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail . The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing . Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm Trail Days . Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women . The men will be in western attire , including Stetsons and colored vests . Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas , in tall bushes ; ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes . There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests . Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip . Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy McKee , George McElyee , Jack Fanning , W. H. Roquemore and Joe Darrow . The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto `` Go Somewhere , Anywhere , Everywhere '' . Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe . In the past , the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica , buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston . Four parties are given a year . Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity . Serving on the club's board are Mmes R. P. Anderson , president ; ; A. F. Schmalzried , secretary ; ; W. H. Roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : Mmes McKee , publicity ; ; Lawrence B. Jones , yearbook , and Sam Laughlin , scrapbook . A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . She lives in Wellsville , Mo. . Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . And the third time was the charm . She dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist . The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges . Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs. Norman Chandler , chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee , and Mr. Chandler . Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts . A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton Becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex . Foliage will glow at formal fall party Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening . More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring . Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William A. Thompson , Van Cott Niven , A. B. Cox , David Bricker , Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson . Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins , and J. Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson . Guests from across U.S. honor Dr. Swim When Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country . A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points . Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles . He started practice in 1917 , and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners . Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing . She put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in Budapest . Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles . Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna . There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . And there she had her first showing of tapestry work . There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today . What most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . Getting to and from school was no problem . They either walked or were driven . Now they go to a high school that is two miles away . One might think the problem would be similar . They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . It's much more complex than that . Generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . `` Why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? I suggested . `` My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois '' . `` Did you '' ? ? I was asked . `` No '' , I said , `` I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois '' . I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . I had to ride a streetcar two miles . Sometimes the streetcar was late . Sometimes there weren't even any seats . I had to stand up , with the ladies . Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . She has to have at least one car herself . I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . Even that isn't satisfactory . If they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . They say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . The logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself . The solution , naturally , is the bus . However , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . But that's hardly realistic . Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an education . Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week . Published annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman . Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . Stars for marriage Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year . Last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane Cooper , daughter of the Grant B. Coopers , to Robert Knox Worrell , and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard Pen Tudor . Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan McFarland Chandler Jr. ; ; Joanne Curry , daughter of the Ellsworth Currys , to James Hartley Gregg , and Valerie Smith to James McAlister Duque . Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning , daughter of the George L. Brownings , to Austin C. Smith Jr. ; ; Cynthia Flower , daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr. , to Todd Huntington , son of the David Huntingtons . Pasadena listings Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins 3 . She is the former Judy Chapman , daughter of John S. Chapman of this city . The young couple live in Pasadena . Another marriage of note is that of Jane McAlester and William Louis Pfau . Changes in address are noted . For instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly Rd. , are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills . Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd. . The Richard Beesemyers , formerly of Connecticut , have returned to Southern California and are now residing on South Arden Blvd. . But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their residence in Southern California for Mexico City . More new addresses Judge and Mrs. Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach , while the Frank Wangemans have moved from Beverly Hills to New York , where he is general manager of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . And Lawrence Chase , son of the Ransom Chases , is listed at his new address in Oxford , Eng. . Others listed at new addresses are the Richard T. Olerichs , the Joseph Aderholds Jr. , the Henri De La Chapelles , the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton Crispin , the John Armisteads , the Allen Chases , the Howard Lockies , the Thomas Lockies , and Anthony Longinotti . Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones , formerly of Panama ; ; the Geddes MacGregors , formerly of Scotland , and Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Althaus , formerly of Switzerland . Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L '' , the foot of the `` L '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . Pulling strings Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . In this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . The scalloped edge is particularly appealing . Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era . A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden . Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . Solid investment There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge . The Cumbancheros , Latin combo , open Tuesday at the Four O'Clock Club . `` Flip '' Phillips for a return engagement at Fireside Steak Ranch Wednesday ; ; same date , Johnny LaSalle trio to the Jolly Roger . Dick Carroll and his accordion ( which we now refer to as `` Freida '' ) held over at Bahia Cabana where `` Sir '' Judson Smith brings in his calypso capers Oct. 13 . Johnny Leighton picked up some new numbers out in Texas which he's springing on the ringsiders in the Rum House at Galt Ocean Mile Hotel . `` Skip '' Hovarter back in town from a summer in the Reno-Lake Tahoe area where he ran into Rusty Warren , Kay Martin , the Marskmen and Tune Toppers -- all pulling good biz , he says . We like Fike Al Fike , an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado , is currently pursuing the three R's -- rhythm , reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel . Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring . Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano , Wes Robbins , bass and trumpet , and Jack Kelly on drums . It's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie , it's Al's all the way . Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . He skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act . This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal . New owners Cafe Society opens formally this afternoon under its new ownership . George Kissak is the bossman ; ; Terry Barnes has been named manager . Spot retains the same decor although crystal chandeliers have been installed above the terrace dining area , and the kitchen has undergone a remodeling job .

The business education program operates with the cooperation of local high schools and business firms . Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ? More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church . At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged . A young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force . He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing . Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it . When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it . The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church . And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity . So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program . This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; ; a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; ; and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days , by Ted Place , director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ , and Jon Braun , director of Campus Crusade for Christ . The second half of the film `` Communism on the Map '' and the movie `` Operation Abolition '' also will be shown . Response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon . And to encourage other churches to try their own programs , Kern said this Sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations . The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week . Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter family , 3181 SW 24th Ter. , will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church . It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies . The first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life . `` When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows '' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class . Until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home . They have five daughters -- Coral Lee , 5 , Glenda Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months . But after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories . To their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part . Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her . Dade's chief probation officer , Jack Blanton , will lead a discussion on `` The Changes in the American Family '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church . Mr. and Mrs. George Treadwell will be honored at a Family Week supper and program at 6 p.m. Sunday at Trinity Methodist Church . He is the sexton of the church . A family worship service will follow the program at 7:45 p.m. . The outstanding family of Central Nazarene Church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10:45 a.m. Sunday service marking National Family Week . Every family of Riviera Presbyterian Church has been asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during National Christian Family Week and to undertake one project in which all members of the family participate . To start the week of special programs at the church , the Rev. John D. Henderson will preach on `` A Successful Marriage '' at 9:40 and 11 a.m. Sunday . New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service . A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men's Club will be held at 6:15 p.m. Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next Saturday . The week will end with the Rev. Mr. Henderson preaching on `` The Marriage Altar '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday , May 14 . The resignation of the Rev. Warren I. Densmore , headmaster of St. Stephen's Episcopal Day School in Coconut Grove , becomes effective July 15 . Enrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced .

The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . In announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . This work is no favorite of mine . I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation . Precise The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it . These qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet . Oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov . This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics . But , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned . Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . Hit Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky . Vladilen Semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . The production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society . The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players . Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; annual members may attend for $16 . Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ) . Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut Street , San Francisco 9 . San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children . Fire Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen . Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year . They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association , at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16th Street and Roosevelt Way . From the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution . Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San Francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 . Requests must be mailed in by December 5 . Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin . President Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said , `` We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . After all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita '' . It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . If that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fell . After television , `` La Dolce Vita '' seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night . I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week . I believe TV watchers will be bored . `` La Dolce Vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western . Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet '' . There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip '' . There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . In another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater . Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull . Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall . What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! As A moral shocker it is a dud . But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film . The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly : `` This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . And when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .

It is very chic to drive foreign cars . With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back . You must also wear a car coat . The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive . But we couldn't really get along without it . `` Where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha '' ? ? Asked the gas station man . The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor . Gas station people are very debonair about small cars . When I drove a car with tail fins , I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases . My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth . This excellent foreign bomb takes only six . When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me . `` Tires OK ? ? Check the oil and water , sir ? ? '' They polished the windshield . They had a loving touch . The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank . `` What kind of car is it '' ? ? He asked gloomily . `` It is a British Austin , the smallest they make '' . `` Get much mileage '' ? ? `` About 35 '' . The gas station man sighed unhappily . `` What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? Crunch , that's all she wrote '' . `` I will die rich '' . `` That will be $1.80 '' , said the gas station man . `` The windshield looks pretty clean '' . Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! ! When I wheeled about , finned fore and aft , I was the darling of the doormen . Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely .

High blood pressure can get the best of any of us . ) At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J. . Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . It is the AID's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . It will be painted to match the paneling in the room . The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project . Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators . Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston . President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C. . But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert . It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People '' to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House . She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her . As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner '' and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief '' . `` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them '' , President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl . After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said , `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States . `` This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House '' . As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston . `` The nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the President commented . Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District . Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff . Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . Henry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the `` Stars and Stripes Forever '' . Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring . He said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert . One of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . `` I was an art major in college '' , Miss Baldrige explained . `` I've been here so many times I couldn't count them '' . She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of education . Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's `` Alba Madonna '' and `` texture '' in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral . Everybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionist . Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard Bales . I'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy ' '' . Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards . In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century . A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra Angelico . The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 . They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order . The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple . A reception and tea followed . About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States . The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m. . A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington , one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria . The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . She accused him of ignoring her . He in turn told her she demanded too much . They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . Mary decided she had had enough . Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer . Family Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area . They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest them . For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . They are now working together toward solving their difficulties . John received a promotion in his firm . He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area . Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund . Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . For crucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . Mr. Kennedy replied : `` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting . Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . Road to Vienna The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. . That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement . On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident . The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . Pre-inaugural position Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : `` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . Attitude flexible At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . Deadlock on tests The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future . Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies . The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable . Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week . Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . The Washington announcement said : `` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . The outlook The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . Other allies consulted There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . Mollusks are a case in point . The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . This is not an isolated example ; ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . `` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . Adequate compensation is indispensable . Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . The committee remains unresponsive . Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; it must play a game in which there never is a winner . The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . ( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . ( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . ( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . ( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . ) If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . The problem must be faced squarely . If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; but many against combining to raise it '' . Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . The courts shared the opinion of the employers . In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : `` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . It was most effective against trade unions . In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . The law could not suspend economics . Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company . The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . ( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? ) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 1 ) Cuba . Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . `` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . `` That limit has now been reached '' . Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . 2 ) Laos . After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . `` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' . Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos . French & Indians . There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . `` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man . But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos . The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West . He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj . `` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' . Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day . The Congress turmoil in the House As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . Deadly deadlock . There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness . A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech . For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . Equal treatment . There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons . In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' . ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple . `` Unconscionable '' ! ! He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! ! Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee . Threat of war . As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose . His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus . The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer . ( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? ) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash . But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . `` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader . `` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . Battle in the senate The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech . Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . Republicans last act Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration . One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . `` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . `` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . And that is just what happened on the last few holes . The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . Player was the first to feel its teeth . After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . He bogeyed the 10th . After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears . He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower . Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt . Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe . The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . End at seven Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 . His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer . More than a streak had ended . Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . Player won only one . But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer . He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 . Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami . When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . Instant rivalry On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . ( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe . ) On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . The boldness of champions Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . Bob Jones played that way . Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . This day Palmer had started first . As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . `` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . This is Baseball 1961 . This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge . In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . Double threat : Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real . After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs . After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 . Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them . To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish . All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record . In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . ) `` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox . `` It has to be easier with two of them . How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ? Roommates : Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' . But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 . Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) . The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together . Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport . The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium . Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris . As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) . To an extent , the two even look alike . Both have blue eyes and short blond hair . Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York . Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each . Light reading : Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' . Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . `` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ? A reporter asked Maris recently . `` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' . This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken . But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . `` See that kid '' ? ? He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . `` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's . I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' . Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . `` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone . I'm angry '' . By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man . Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you . Send me where I can play '' . ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. . ) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench . Play me '' . ( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series . ) `` That's the way I am '' , he says . `` I tell people what I think . If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . Idols' idols : One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . Maris's was Ted Williams . `` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . `` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ? `` Are you kidding '' ? ? Said Maris . `` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio . `` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . But DiMaggio never said a word . It crushed Mickey . He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' . Mantle has kept the vow . Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track . If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine . But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball . They try to play baseball the best they can . Each is a complete ballplayer . Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . ( `` One of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris '' . ) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed . They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . Mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( , fourth in the league , to for Maris so far this year ) . Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base . Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox . Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; Maris's throwing arm is stronger . Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run . With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season . ( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams . Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place . Appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment . In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . Something was needed to revive interest ; ; the something was the home run . Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law . Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory . Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each . The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles . Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots . Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . A few of these people are still around '' . Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways . At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. . Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate . The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while . The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics . Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making . To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A.A.U.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete of 1960 . As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.S. Open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year . Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix , Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination . `` I'm a slob '' , he announced . `` My taste is gaudy . I'm useless for anything but racing cars . I'm ruddy lazy , and I'm getting on in years . It gets so frustrating , but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing '' . Has Moss no stirling virtues ? ? `` I appreciate beauty '' . One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 . Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because `` I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future '' . Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : `` I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh . There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause . On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' . He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures . He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world . All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city . But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block . At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . Break in Georgia The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . `` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . Catch for Chicago When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . But they were not . They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; they put much effort into public housing . They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . But almost all the schools were primary . The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! '' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! ) . The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . It is hard to blame them for this . Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . There were four principal ones . First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . Confusion became chaos ; ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . '' Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . ( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . ) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . Lumumba fired Kasavubu . Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . The presidency : talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . And that was not all . In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . Crime : ' skyjacked ' From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix . Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . `` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said . `` I figured he was sick '' . John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . `` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said . `` The other fellow had a '' . Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . Stalling : `` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; they would have to refuel at El Paso . Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . `` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . Tension The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : Take off or see the hostages killed . The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; the plane slowed to a halt . Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . The day wore on . At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . ( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . ) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' . Congress : more muscle Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . ( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . ) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . In other areas , Congressional action last week included : The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . Food : stew a la Mulligatawny Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . Tax-free returns . Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . Swelling traffic . A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . Slow successes . Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . That improvement is continuing . In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . Many rate increases already have been put into effect . Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . Easier access . Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . For some roads , troubles . Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . These , however , are exceptions . The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- `` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : `` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . About half of these are exported . `` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . `` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . `` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . `` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . `` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . `` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . `` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . It's an important clue to Washington thinking . Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . `` Get competitive or get out '' . In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . Government research will look into new products and methods . Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . They threaten to strike . The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . Some library boards are wary of the plan . A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . All services are given without cost to members . So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . The system passes on these savings to its members . Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . Books are not the only resource of the system . Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . The need for lifetime reading is apparent . Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; if we do not know how to use what we do read . We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . Only public understanding and support can provide that service . This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! !\""

              "\"The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . `` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . Merger proposed However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . `` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . Wards protected The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . `` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . Ask jail deputies On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . ( 2 ) Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . His petition charged mental cruelty . The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin . Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . The petition listed the mayor's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. . The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. Aj . Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney . Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1 . He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday . Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker . In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended . When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign . Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time . He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . Construction bonds Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways . A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work . A revolving fund The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin . The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances . Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . Colquitt -- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' . The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402 . Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . `` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said . `` Being at the polls was just like being at church . I didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' . The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . `` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` There wasn't a bit of trouble '' . Austin , Texas -- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . Austin , Texas -- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . `` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . One validated acts of school districts . Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . Two tax revision bills were passed . One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . Austin , Texas -- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . Austin , Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . `` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . `` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . This would help the little peanut districts '' . Austin , Texas -- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . `` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover . College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . Paris , Texas ( sp. ) -- The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president . Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma . He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A & I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla. . In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology . During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College . He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army . Denton , Texas ( sp. ) -- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . `` Must solve problem '' The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . `` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . Calls for extension Other recommendations made by the committee are : Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . Fears prejudicial aspects `` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . `` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ? `` Yes , your honor '' , replied Bellows . `` What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . There is a conflict among the defendants '' . Washington , July 24 -- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio . The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone . Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion . Decisions are made Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' . Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city . The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' . Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases . In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' . Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutor . Issue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury . Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation . Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning . Karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' . He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the Criminal court processes . `` Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court . Faced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons . Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another . The cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward . The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns . Two other cases also were under advisement . Claims precedent lacking After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them . Washington , Feb. 9 -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill . It was defeated in Congress last year . Cost up to $37 a year It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . Outlays would increase Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . Both figures would go higher in later years . Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . Nursing home care The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 2 Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 3 Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . 4 Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . Calls proposal modest He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . `` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . `` This is not a program of socialized medicine . It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . Wouldn't pay doctors The plan does not cover doctor bills . They would still be paid by the patient . Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . Contributions to schools The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . More for nursing homes In the area of `` community health services '' , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . Asks research funds The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . He did not say by how much . For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . Reaction as expected Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan . Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the House . Washington , Feb. 9 -- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . Enforce by demand The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 . Oslo The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . Explosion avoided In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . Exploratory mood A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited . The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters . The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . Conflict surveyed The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . This increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . Washington The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos . The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this . The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated . But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . Policies modified The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference . This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union . He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . GOP restrained It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it . They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba . One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score . His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination . Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators . Detente urged This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' . It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation . But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated . Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors . Aid plans revamped Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . But thus far there has been no response in kind . Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture . Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos . But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate . And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos . But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos . ( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however . ) There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam . The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos . The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army . There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt . If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna . Washington The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States . The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . Offenses multiply The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . East Providence now has no civil defense program . Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . He is not interested in being named a full-time director . Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . Mr. Hawksley said . One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station . He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area . Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point . Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly . The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls . A copy was released to the press . Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant . The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said . `` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , Mr. Notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' . The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws . The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath . The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday . The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday '' , the council's resolution said . The small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday . They `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' . That , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . `` That was before I studied law . Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. . The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post . Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . `` After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . `` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' . He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . `` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September . Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system . Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting . Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance . At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition . Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . `` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? He asked . The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . `` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark . Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' . Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . `` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , Mitchell said . Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . `` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , Jones said . The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . Defends Ike Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : `` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . `` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . `` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' . Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . `` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . That failed . `` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . That , too , will fail '' . Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 . Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner . Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals . `` My experience as public safety commissioner '' , Roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . Jim Sheeran fits that description '' . Trenton -- William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service . A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section . Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education . Boonton -- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' . He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : `` When I come back here after the November election you'll think , ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' . He said , `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time '' . Attacks Republicans In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . But we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . `` We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November '' . He said , `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' . He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy '' . He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . `` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean '' , the former Superior Court judge said . `` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s '' . Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people '' , Hughes asked , `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November '' . Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's `` Green Acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday . Conservation plan The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state . The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . Hughes said , `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it '' , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve '' . Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved . He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans . `` After the primary '' , he promised , `` I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee '' . Trenton -- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters . A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment . She served one four-year term on the national committee . Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . Opposition reported Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader . Mayor visits Buckley As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader . He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor . Screvane and Beame hailed The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller . The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx . After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York Times . The Mayor said : `` It didn't come from me . But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates '' . Boston , June 16 -- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . `` It's ' See Joe , see Jim ' '' , he says . `` The hand is out '' . A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , `` The Last Hurrah '' . But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations . And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . Day after day some new episode is reported . The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . Washington , June 18 -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee . It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor . Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday . Leadership is hopeful The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy . They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts . Three groups to meet What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 . This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee . About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview . Six of these were proposed by religious groups . They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . Question raised Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . When he protested , the hotel owner said : `` Why do you worry ? ? The U. S. Government is paying for it . The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' . Missionary explains `` I don't work for the Government '' , the American said . `` I'm a missionary '' . The hotel owner shrugged . `` Same thing '' , he said . And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . Moscow , June 18 -- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : `` Look , he took everything I had '' ! ! Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker . Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid . The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates . This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 . In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries . United Nations , N. Y. , June 18 -- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations . This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations . One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India . India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations . Formula is due this week The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week . The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start . Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point . Geneva , June 18 -- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ; Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces . The latter two are half-brothers . Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos . An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded . But no one was overly optimistic . Tactics studied in Geneva W. Averell Harriman of the United States , Malcolm MacDonald of Britain , Maurice Couve De Murville , France's Foreign Minister , and Howard C. Green , Canada's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week . Princess Moune , Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter , read the Princes' statement . They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she said . The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days . To deal with principles The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government . Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill. . Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . They reside at 4911 Miles Dr. . Washington -- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . Many buildings Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . Seats on square Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House . In this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans . Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units . About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . Division one of the parade will be the service academies . Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson . Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union . Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; ; division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states . Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa , the trust territories and the Canal Zone . Jackson , Miss. -- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ? Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett . Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year . Could be scramble Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session . The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . Districts issue Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature . Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House . Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . Future clouded Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election . Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . Baton Rouge , La. -- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . Legislators weary Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes . Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy . If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature . Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . Underlying concern Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition . He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . Constant problem In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature . This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract . The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . Concern bankrupt The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d St. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law . On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr. . Intervenes in case The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms . Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co. . At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . `` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , Berger said . The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track . The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints . The city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged . Wide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint . The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per joint . But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint . Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference . Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company . `` We won't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , Wagner said . `` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , Berger said . Wagner replied , `` Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172,000 ' '' ? ? ' know enough to sue ' Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El . `` We want to find out who knew about it '' , Pratt said . `` Certain people must have known about it '' . `` The PTC is investigating the whole matter '' , Pratt said . Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year . Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee . For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said . Testifies at hearing His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services . The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that . The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room . The cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 . Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels . Revenue estimated The city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year . The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses . A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs . The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog . Commissioner replies Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care . In reply , Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees . He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites . Backs higher fees City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year . The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said . The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis . Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday , it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car . The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower , Davenport said . Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time . He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning . Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery , 39 . His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation . The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project . The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project . One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 . The tract is bounded by Island Ave. , Dicks Ave. , 61st St. , and Eastwick Ave. . Four parks planned It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores . The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project . The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project . Would bar vehicles The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp. . The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic . It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project . The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development . The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project . Kansas City , Mo. , Feb. 9 ( UPI ) -- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work . Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles . He was in Baptist Memorial hospital . Ignition sets off blast The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work . `` I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway '' , he said . Gladden's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house . The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall . Hood flies over house The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house . The left front wheel landed 100 feet away . Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel . It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter . Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night . The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union . Led fight on teamsters Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 . The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing . A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City , Kas. . The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett . Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee . Both have been active in the association . Ankara , Turkey , Oct. 24 ( AP ) -- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president . An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat . By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government . The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president . Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months . The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned . Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own . Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . He is married and the father of three children . Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E. M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . `` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . Patience needed Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up '' . Martin called for patience on the part of Americans . `` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build '' , he said . By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . Individual help best `` We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient '' , the assistant secretary said . Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost '' . Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack . But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful '' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . `` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster '' , he said . `` Nobody really expects to evacuate . I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand '' , said , `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' . Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' . Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program . The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done . Salem ( AP ) -- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov. Mark Hatfield . Hatfield also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception in the state capitol on Tuesday . His schedule calls for a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club . He will speak to Willamette University Young Republicans Thursday night in Salem . On Friday he will go to Portland for the swearing in of Dean Bryson as Multnomah County Circuit Judge . He will attend a meeting of the Republican State Central Committee Saturday in Portland and see the Washington-Oregon football game . Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session . A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January . Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system . Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools . Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen. Wayne L. Morse , Aj . The dinner is sponsored by organized labor and is scheduled for 7 p.m. . Secretary Goldberg and Sen. Morse will hold a joint press conference at the Roosevelt Hotel at 4:30 p.m. Sunday , Blaine Whipple , executive secretary of the Democratic Party of Oregon , reported Tuesday .

Seeking this two-year term are James Culbertson , Dwight M. Steeves , James C. Piersee , W.M. Sexton and Theodore W. Heitschmidt . A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum . The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible . At the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' . New point added Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : `` The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' . The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- His miracles -- His substitutionary work on the cross -- His bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of God . Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God . His offices are in Springfield , Mo. . Election came on the nominating ballot . Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , `` Breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with `` Breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years . The Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work . `` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life '' , he told delegates Friday . Church loses pace Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' . `` In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches '' , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . `` In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none '' , he said . To step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years . To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . ' church meets change ' `` The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' . A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches . -- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . -- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . -- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial . Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' . Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : `` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out '' . In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . Siebern hits homer Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . House throws wild With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . Robinson doubles again In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . Carey Singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon . Miami , Fla. , March 17 -- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players . The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row . 15 pounds lighter The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence . When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . Seeks `` improved fielding '' The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees . Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest . Duren , Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers . Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter . Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . Squad cut near Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky. . The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . Unfortunately , Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers . Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; ; J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn . Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast . `` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo , too '' , added Old Scrapiron . `` Then we'd really have someplace to go '' . Bowie , Md. , March 17 -- Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. , Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 8,280 attend races Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss . A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . Culmone gets first win Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve . She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . Cleveland , March 17 ( AP ) -- George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield . Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn . Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . San Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here . Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . St. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) -- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today . Austin , Texas -- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . `` This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . `` So I started practicing on it in spring training . Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . `` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . `` Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . Practice helps you to get your timing down . `` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session . `` If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . Footnotes : In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma . Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . It didn't ; ; Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University . The Mustangs don't play this week . `` We're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy . `` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' . Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . We needed it and we got it '' . Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon . Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . `` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . `` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory . `` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . `` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . `` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . `` He almost brought it back all the way '' . Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . `` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . `` He'll be out of action all this week . He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . `` He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run '' , Meek explained . `` We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play '' . The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . `` We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . We'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off '' . SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21 . Huddle hearsay -- Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A & M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud . End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury . The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout Monday . The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one . The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb . Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions . `` Just our luck '' ! ! Exclaimed Stram . `` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . `` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . `` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . `` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback . He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . A quick touchdown resulted . `` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I'll put that play in the book '' . The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas , Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week . Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A & M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . Texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) . A & M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight . They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left . Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout . The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove . Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies . The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . Bingles and bobbles : Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits . It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ . Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage . Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . Dallas , Tex. , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . St. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday . Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans . It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss . The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left . The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard . Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front . A double by Green , Allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth . Ogden , Utah , May 1 -- ( AP ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . `` I've had it '' , he told a newsman . `` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' . This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited . She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : `` I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances '' . The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes . Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I don't think you want to talk to him . You'll probably get a ball bat on the head . He's mad at the world '' . But Jackie had gone into the station . Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . `` I told him who I was and he was quite cold . But he warmed up after a while . I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . He said he had never talked to Liston '' . Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : `` I can't hit anymore . I can't run . I can't throw . Suddenly my reflexes are gone . Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . `` Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field . Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road . Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle . This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace . In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . Once the figure was 30-30 . Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey's . The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park . It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off . Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy . This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) -- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning . Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter . The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager . Only Bucky Harris , the `` boy-manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . Choice was expected The selection had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . Coach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. . He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year . Show follows ceremonies A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . Flushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . Shea was born in Manhattan . He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . Maris is in line for a big raise . Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280-yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . No margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . So he wound up with a dozen . `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . Stickler for rules `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . `` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . `` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . He had a 16 . Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . Nor were there any rules to save him . If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . This knowledge has come in handy , too . His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . The ball floated downstream . A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . Ruling from on high `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? Asked Palmer of an official . `` No '' , said the official . `` You must play it where it lies '' . `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : `` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season . `` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . `` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . Change in pitchers . Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . After Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium . Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game . Mizell has won both of his starts . Nieman kept in lineup . After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants . `` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said . `` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' . `` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . `` He should be getting back in the groove before long . Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday . Six Bucks over . Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each , Dick Stuart , Don Hoak and Bob Skinner . Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet . Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs . Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . `` We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . `` Virdon has been blasting the ball . No plunkers for him '' . Six Bucs over . The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season . On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . In 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 . A year later they were 4-13 . Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times . The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 . The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . They honored the battling Billikens last night . Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer . In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do . `` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch . Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory . Benington said , `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . After the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me '' . Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award . Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington . On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 '' . Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich . `` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out . `` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game . Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City . The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday . Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple . St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field . The game opened a busy week for Washington . The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . Happy hitting If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . And that's meant as a boost , not a knock . Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . Their heights , that is . Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie . His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . Labor relations Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . The old man was almost too possessive . Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York . With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far . The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark . Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother , J. Hampton Monroe , and Mrs. Monroe .

Young Peter Wendell , a student at the Westminster school , has measles , and his sister , Mrs. Andrew Thomas , and her husband , who live in Missoula , Mont. , have a new baby . Their mother is Mrs. Camilla Alsop Wendell . Mr. Wendell and his bride will live in his Lake Forest house . They will take a wedding trip later . ' back with the Met `` We are back with the ' Met ' again now that the ' Met ' is back in Chicago '' , bulletins Mrs. Frank S.

Birgit Nilsson will be starred . `` Housed in the new McCormick Place theater , this should prove to be an exciting evening '' , adds Mrs. Sims . The board's last money raising event was a performance by Harry Belafonte -- `` quite off-beat for this group '' , decided some of the members . Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of Winnetka , a new board member , will be chairman of publicity for the benefit . Her husband recently was appointed vice president of the university , bringing them back here from the east . Parichy-Hamm Because of the recent death of the bride's father , Frederick B. Hamm , the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St. Bernadine's church , Forest Park . A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel . Mrs. Hamm will not come from Vero Beach , Fla. , for the wedding . However , Mr. Parichy and his bride will go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip , and will stay in the John G. Beadles' beach house . The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest . Harvey B. Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in marriage . Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and the bride's other uncles and aunts , the Rush C. Butlers , the Homer E. Robertsons , and the David Q. Porters , will give the bridal dinner tonight in the Stevenses' home . Here and there The Chicago Press club will fete George E. Barnes , president of the United States Lawn Tennis association , at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow . Later , a bus will carry members to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional tennis matches at 8 p.m. . With loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St. Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears , its director , Helen Tieken Geraghty ( Mrs. Maurice P. Geraghty ) is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International Trade fair . Armed with letters from embassies to ministers of countries , especially those in the near and far east , Mrs. Geraghty `` will beat the bushes for oriental talent '' . `` We ( the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry ) expect to establish closer relations with nations and their cultural activities , and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts '' , explains Mrs. Geraghty . `` For instance , Djakarta , Indonesia , has three groups of dancers interested in coming here . I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus '' ! ! The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa . First , Honolulu Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop . Then Japan , Hong Kong , Manila , India , Pakistan , Damascus , Beirut , and to Rome , London , and Paris `` to look over wonderful talent '' . Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return ; ; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter , Molly , bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night . Molly already has her cotillion gown , and it's fitted , says her mother . Also , invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts club . It won't be a `` tea '' , however , but more of an international folk song festival , with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world . The international theme will be continued with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will give in the Racquet club after the tea . Miss Abra Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day . Burke-Rostagno The Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter , Helen Lambert , and the young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith college . He is Aldo Rostagno , son of the Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in Europe . The Burkes , who now live in Kankakee , are telling friends of the engagement . Miss Burke , a graduate of Miss Hall's school , stayed on in Florence as a career girl . Her fiance , who is with a publishing firm , translates many books from English into Italian . He will be coming here on business in December , when the wedding is to take place in Wayne . Miss Burke will arrive in December also . Here and there A farewell supper Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Sethness Jr. planned Sunday for Italian Consul General and Mrs. Giacomo Profili has been canceled because Mr. Sethness is in Illinois Masonic hospital for surgery . Mrs. William Odell , Mrs. Clinton B. King , John Holabird Jr. , Norman Boothby , and Actress Maureen O'Sullivan will judge the costumes in the grand march at the Affaire Old Towne Bal Masque tomorrow in the Germania club .

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. . The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a `` civilian '' with the Army . Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . The job also covers a number of other items . `` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . `` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . `` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . `` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` No Vacancy '' . No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . And where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? Ah , that is simple . Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . That is where we turn in the good old summertime . The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . Many with pools Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . All for $14 ! ! At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . All for $14 . That made up for the `` best '' motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church . Parents of the bride are Mr. and Mrs. Ferris M. Gay , 7034 Coronado . The bridegroom is the son of Mrs. James Baines of Los Angeles , Calif. , and Carl E. Howard of Santa Monica , Calif. .

Her husband , who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport , La. , and the late Mrs. Henry Cater Parmer , was president of Alpha Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at Lamar Tech , and did graduate work at Rhodes University in Grahamstown , South Africa , on a Rotary Fellowship . The Rev. Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs. Marvin Hand presented music . The bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed with bateau neckline and princesse skirt accented by lace appliques . Her veil was caught to a crown , and she carried gardenias and stephanotis . Miss Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor , and bridesmaids were Miss Pat Dawson of Austin , Mrs. Howard M. Dean of Hinsdale , Ill. , and Mrs. James A. Reeder of Shreveport , La. . Cecil Mason of Hartford , Conn. , was best man for his brother , and groomsmen were Rhodes S. Baker 3 , of Houston , Dr. James Carter of Houston and Conrad McEachern of New Orleans , La. . Lee Jackson and Ken Smith , both of Houston , and Alfred Neumann of Beaumont seated guests . After a reception at The Mayfair , the newlyweds left for a wedding trip to New Orleans , La. . They will live in Corpus Christi . Miss Shirley Joan Meredith , a former student of North Texas State University , was married Saturday to Larry W. Mills , who has attended Arlington State College . They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh after a wedding trip to Corpus Christi . Parents of the couple are Ray Meredith of Denton and the late Mrs. Meredith and Mrs. Hardy P. Mills of Floresville and the late Mr. Mills . The Rev. Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony in Slaughter Chapel of the First Baptist Church . Dan Beam presented music and the bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse lines and featuring a flared skirt and lace jacket with bateau neckline . Her veil was caught to a pearl headdress , and she carried stephanotis and orchids . Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's maid of honor , and Vernon Lewelleyn of San Angelo was best man . Robert Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr. seated guests . A reception was held at the church . The First Christian Church of Pampa was the setting for the wedding last Sunday of Miss Marcile Marie Glison and Thomas Earl Loving Jr. , who will live at 8861 Gaston after a wedding trip to New Orleans , La. The bride , daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Ervin Glison of Pampa , has attended Texas Woman's University and will continue her studies at Aj . `` A Night in New Orleans '' is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . Mrs. H. J. Grinsfelder is chairman . The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality `` and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night '' , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , `` that is exactly what we expect to offer them . We've been working for weeks . The prospects look great . We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . But we can't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' . Basin Street Beat But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will `` give with the Basin Street beat '' during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the dancing . As for food , Mrs. Henry Louchheim , chairman of this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food . `` New Orleans '' ? ? She says , `` of course I've had the best . It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no R's , so no oysters . But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties . I know they will be good . We've tried them out on the club chef -- or say , he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best '' . Scenic effects Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic effects . There will be masses of flowers , reproductions of the handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are typical of New Orleans . Mrs. Harry K. Cohen is chairman of this phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A. Van Hollander , display director of Gimbel Brothers . The gala is the Thrift Shop's annual bundle party and , as all Thrift Shop friends know , that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition , contributions of household equipment , bric-a-brac and such to stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St. . Bundle centers For the convenience of guests bundle centers have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations may be deposited between now and the date of the big event . In addition to the bundles , guests pay the cost of their dinners . Members of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing time are welcomed . The Thrift Shop , with Mrs. Bernhard S. Blumenthal as president , is one of the city's most successful fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies . Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000 . It's big business `` Big business , this little Thrift Shop business '' , say the members . For most of the 25 years the operation was under feminine direction . In the past few years the men , mostly husbands of members , have taken an interest . Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's committee that , among other jobs , takes over part of the responsibility for staffing the shop during its evening hours . Mrs. Theodore Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee for the gala . Mrs. Richard Newburger is chairman of hostesses .

Besides the bundle centers where contributions may be made there will be facilities at Philmont Country Club for those who would like to bring the bundles on the night of the party . The women's committee of St. David's Church will hold its annual pre-Fair pink parade , a dessert bridge and fashion show at 1 p.m. on Monday , April 17 , in the chapel assembly room , Wayne .

The boys love it '' . Mrs. John Charles Cotty is chairman of publicity for the country fair and Mrs. Francis G. Felske and Mrs. Francis Smythe , of posters . They all are of Wayne . `` Meet the Artist '' is the invitation issued by members of the Greater Philadelphia Section of the National Council of Jewish Women as they arrange for an annual exhibit and sale of paintings and sculpture at the Philmont Country Club on April 8 and 9 .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . Salary cut and lay-offs It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 2 Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street . In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken Street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home . The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis . His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body . Boy in fair condition The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . His condition was reported to be fair . Police said the children's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . Cites discrepancies Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . `` I hate to have these things come up again and again '' , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . `` These are the board's minutes . I'll write what you tell me to '' . For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so . State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street . He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance . Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . His condition was said to be , `` fair '' . Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street . Barber summoned He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month . Werner criticized Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December . Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , Mr. Schaefer said . The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations '' on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm . Sent home for rest Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest . Work resumed Wednesday , he said . Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced '' . Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' . Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes . Annapolis , Jan. 7 ( special ) -- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention . The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 . Each had been shot in the back several times with a automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives . Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail . The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court . Younger son calls police Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car . The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio . Two brothers adopted Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs . Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis . The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said . Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland's Secretary of State . Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named Attorney General to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals . Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday . Simpkins from Somerset Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child . Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947 . Five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law . Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 . From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates . Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported . Dodge reported the following breakdown : Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house . Convenience held key `` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 '' , Pantas predicted . Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section . Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation . London , Feb. 9 -- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . Five held for trial The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . A full trial was ordered for : Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . Flashed to Moscow A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . ( In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City ) . In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . All five pleaded innocent . Only Miss Gee asked for bail . Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . Refuses to grant bail `` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . He promptly went to communist East Germany . The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . `` This is Russian money '' , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office . He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . `` Of highest value '' The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . Court cleared Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it . Navy's future involved `` Much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . `` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . Interested in detector The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . Range was a vital detail . Designs of parts were sought . Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . ' had to know peddlers ' `` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , Sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . This , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . `` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' . No comments by U.S. In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana Av. . Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan Av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted . Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart Av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way . Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee . His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck . Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School , 30th Street and South Park Way , and began `` skylarking '' . When 51st Street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor . As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down . Then the youths fled with his money . Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier . She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office . Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 . It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place . The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 . The defendant , William L. Stickney 3 , 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month . Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay Rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president . Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street . At Jenks Street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks . The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie . St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . -- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . Stepson vindicated The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : `` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . Still , I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' . Lives on welfare Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police . He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach . However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial . Charges in doubt Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl . Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . Locked in motel A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . The jury foreman , Mrs. Olive Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence . She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid . The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . The verdict came three hours later . Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . A Sterling Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy . Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs. Mary Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren . Services tomorrow Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne's Catholic Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren . The mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home , 31730 Mound , Warren . Mrs. Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East . Held candle Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . Christine's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; ; Dennis , 6 ; ; Eleanor , 2 ; ; and Bernardine , 1 . `` All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted '' , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon . Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills . A135 donated Neighbor women , such as Mrs. Sidney Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister-in-law , Mrs. Anna Kowalski , 22111 David , East Detroit . Another neighbor , Mrs. Frank C. Smith , 2731 Pall Mall , Sterling Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs . John C. Houghton , president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family . Students help out Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East . He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 , Warren Village Station . Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east . Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski . Funds from dances Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night . `` Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said . There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School , 3505o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine . Expresses thanks Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday . But today he wanted to make a public statement . `` I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family . I wasn't sure there were such people anywhere in the world . I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them '' . An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . Patrolman George Kimmell , of McClellan Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps School , for his assistance in the case . Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk . Gets car number Kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly `` took off at high speed '' , he said , narrowly missing him . Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . Returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive . Given 15 days He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction . The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June . The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today . Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire . Help asked In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its `` friends and neighbors '' for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom . Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home . He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire . A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said . Plea for arms The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana . He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers . He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body . A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown . Heavy support The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam . The minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos . There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated . Havana , April 19 . -- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair . The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio , where the executions took place . Arms plot charged The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels . Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's regime . Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami . McNair , 25 , was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio , about 35 miles from Havana . Report others held At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup . Among them were a number of newsmen , including Henry Raymont , of United Press International , and Robert Berrellez , of Associated Press . So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails . More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests . Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state , few emerge in the West to tell about it . M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF ) -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945 . Today , M. Kegham was in Detroit , en route to join his wife and children in California . Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . `` Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . `` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church . Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation . Urged in 1954 The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . `` From its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said Friday , `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . `` As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . `` There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . Corporate existence `` On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia . `` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education '' . A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street , NE , police said . The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims , 19 , of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir. , Aj . Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole . The other occupants were James Willard Olvey , 18 , of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave. , NE , and Larry Coleman Barnett , 19 , of 704 Hill St. , SE , both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises . The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins '' if negotiations failed . The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights . ' intend to attend ' `` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year '' , the identically worded letters said . The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations . They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate . Downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the Friday mail . However , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend . Gather here The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday . Several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair . Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago . Charles A. Black , COAHR chairman , said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up . He declined to name the three . Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting . Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' . Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '' A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '' Besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead .

Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest . The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup , Pierce , Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants , according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist . Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical , heptachlor , over 30,000 acres in Troup , 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties . The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties , over 37,679 acres . The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon . Also being treated are Houston , Bleckley , Tift , Turner and Dodge counties , Blasingame said . The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia , attacking crops , young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom , Blasingame said . The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week . This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway .

Incidentally , 14th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours . It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue , NE ; ; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street , Aj .

Salem ( special ) -- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . Board oks pact The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . `` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ? Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. . `` My feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him . The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' . Harvey criticized Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday . A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff . `` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this . I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' . Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' . The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G. Huntley was arrested in Phoenix , Ariz. , last week and will be returned to Portland to face charges of assault and robbery , Portland detectives said Friday .

Thomas Rotelli , head of Rhode Island Incinerator Service , Inc. , said four of the company's eight trucks were making collections with both newly hired and regular workers . Sydney Larson , a staff representative for the United Steel Workers , which the firm's 25 workers joined before striking , said the state Labor Relations Board has been asked to set up an election to pick a bargaining agent . A 62-year-old Smithfield man , Lester E. Stone of 19 Beverly Circle , was in satisfactory condition last night at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital , North Providence , with injuries suffered when a car he was driving struck a utility pole on Woonasquatucket Avenue in North Providence near Stevens Street . Mr. Stone suffered fractured ribs and chest cuts , hospital authorities said . He was taken to the hospital by the North Providence ambulance . Before hitting the pole , Mr. Stone's car brushed against a car driven by Alva W. Vernava , 21 , of 23 Maple Ave. , North Providence , tearing away the rear bumper and denting the left rear fender of the Vernava car , police said . Mr. Vernava was uninjured . The impact with the utility pole caused a brief power failure in the immediate area of the accident . One house was without power for about half an hour , a Narragansett Electric Co. spokesman said . The power was off for about five minutes in houses along Smith Street as far away as Fruit Hill Avenue shortly before 5 p.m. when the accident occurred . The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to the state Supreme Court , it appeared last night . Two members of the Democratic-endorsed majority on the school board said they probably would vote to appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education , which said yesterday that the school committee acted improperly in its appointment of the coordinator , Francis P. Nolan 3rd , the Democratic-endorsed committee chairman , could not be reached for comment . In its ruling , the state Board of Education upheld Dr. Michael F. Walsh , state commissioner of education , who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F. Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual education without first finding that the school superintendent's candidate was not suitable . Supt. Clarence S. Taylor had recommended Roger I. Vermeersch for the post . Milton and Rosella Lovett of Cranston were awarded $55,000 damages from the state in Superior Court yesterday for industrial property which they owned at 83 Atwells Ave. , Providence , and which was condemned for use in construction of Interstate Route 95 . The award was made by Judge Fred B. Perkins who heard their petition without a jury by agreement of the parties . The award , without interest , compared with a valuation of $57,500 placed on the property by the property owners' real estate expert , and a valuation of $52,500 placed on it by the state's expert . The property included a one-story brick manufacturing building on 8,293 square feet of land . Saul Hodosh represented the owners . Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent appeared for the state . Santa's lieutenants in charge of the Journal-Bulletin Santa Claus Fund are looking for the usual generous response this year from Cranston residents . Persons who find it convenient may send their contributions to the Journal-Bulletin's Cranston office at 823 Park Avenue . All contributed will be acknowledged . The fund's statewide quota this year is $8,250 to provide Christmas gifts for needy youngsters . Scores of Cranston children will be remembered . Cranston residents have been generous contributors to the fund over the years . Public school children have adopted the fund as one of their favorite Christmas charities and their pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters aid greatly in helping Santa to reach the fund's goal . Bernard Parrillo , 20 , of 19 Fletcher Ave. , Cranston , was admitted to Roger Williams Hospital shortly before 11:30 a.m. yesterday after a hunting accident in which a shotgun he was carrying discharged against his heel . Mr. Parrillo was given first aid at Johnston Hose 1 . ( Thornton ) where he had been driven by a companion . The two had been hunting in the Simmonsville area of town and Mr. Parrillo dropped the gun which fired as it struck the ground . Hospital officials said the injury was severe but the youth was in good condition last night . A check for $4,177.37 representing the last payment of a $50,000 federal grant to Rhode Island Hospital was presented to the hospital administrator , Oliver G. Pratt , yesterday by Governor Notte . The hospital has used the money to assist in alterations on the fifth floor of the Jane Brown Hospital , part of Rhode Island Hospital . The work added eight beds to the hospital , giving it a total capacity of 646 general beds . Vincent Sorrentino , founder and board chairman of the Uncas Mfg. Co. , has been designated a Cavaliere of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy . The decoration will be presented by A. Trichieri , Italian consul general in Boston , at a ceremony at 30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at the plant , which this year is celebrating its golden anniversary . About 500 employes of the firm will be on hand to witness bestowal of the honor upon Mr. Sorrentino . Mr. Sorrentino will be honored on the evening of Dec. 7 at a dinner to be given by the Aurora Club at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel . The Newport-based destroyer picket escort Kretchmer has arrived back at Newport after three months' patrol in North Atlantic waters marked by mercy jobs afloat and ashore . On Sept. 6 , the Kretchmer rescued the crew of a trawler they found drifting on a life raft after they had abandoned a sinking ship . In August while stopping in Greenock , Scotland , three members of the crew on liberty rendered first aid to a girl who fell from a train . Local authorities credited the men with saving the girl's life . Birmingham , Ala. -- ( AP ) -- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the `` Freedom Rider '' bus burning trial four weeks ago . U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury . He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala. . Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders . The bus was burned outside Anniston . One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal . A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . Neither was seated on the jury . Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . The judge replaced the juror with an alternate . No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents . At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections . One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time . He was not seated on the jury . The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction . New York -- ( UPI ) -- The New York University Board of Trustees has elected the youngest president in the 130-year history of NYU , it was announced yesterday . The new president is 37-year-old Dr. James McN. Hester , currently dean of the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . He will take over his new post Jan. 1 . Dr. Hester , also one of the youngest men ever to head a major American university , succeeds Dr. Carroll V. Newsom who resigned last September to join Prentice-Hall Inc. publishing firm . Dr. Hester , of Princeton , N.J. , is a native of Chester , Pa. He joined NYU in September , 1960 . Prior to that he was associated with Long Island University in Brooklyn . Asilomar , March 26 Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . `` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . `` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . `` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society . The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield . Buchheister pledged the land would be an `` inviolate '' sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants . Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . This had never been done before . Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile . He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . `` The first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . `` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . It was time to go up myself '' . Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight . Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . `` She flew beautifully '' , said Fiedler . `` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . `` It's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' . John Di Massimo has been elected president of the 1961 Columbus Day Celebration Committee , it was announced yesterday . Other officers are Angelo J. Scampini , vice president , Joseph V. Arata , treasurer , and Fred J. Casassa , secretary . Judge John B. Molinari was named chairman of the executive committee . Elected to the board of directors were : Elios P. Anderlini , Attilio Beronio , Leo M. Bianco , Frederic Campagnoli , Joseph Cervetto , Armond J. De Martini , Grace Duhagon , John P. Figone , John P. Figone Jr. , Stephen Mana , John Moscone , Calude Perasso , Angelo Petrini , Frank Ratto , and George R. Reilly . Dr. Albert Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale . Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday . In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr. Schweitzer wrote : `` Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . `` They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; otherwise no peace is possible . `` Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency '' . A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service . Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . Glimco a buddy Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti . Another hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview . `` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier '' , Stein said . `` But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll '' . Connection is sought Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex . The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant . Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St. . The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . Lee a witness Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee , director of McCormick Place ; ; Jerome Leavitt , a partner in the Union Liquor company , 3247 S. Kedzie Av. , Dominic Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; and Frank W. Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av. . Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place . Stein's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay . Stein estimated this amount at `` about $1,500 or $1,600 a month '' . A $12,500 payment Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers . Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' union . Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year . All of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt . Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll '' at National Maintenance company . The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av. . The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday . The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . Curtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000 . Lien payments involved Huff's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' . Huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage . Charge lists 3 checks The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the association . The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 . On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av. . There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . Later , Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit card . All bounced . When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police . Bonn , Oct. 24 ( UPI ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today . Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share . But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering . `` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas . Cable confirmation '' , it said translated . But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares . After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . But the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . `` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do . But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . First , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . Second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market . Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up . And third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . Foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . The potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito . All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . Now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars . More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman . It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history . The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars . It weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year . A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area . The Murray Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated in Dallas in 1896 . They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's . More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown . Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm . The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899 . The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 . Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala. . Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala. . About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes . The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world . Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment . The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co. . They export also . The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies . In 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment . Presently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year . The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912 . Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga. . The district office here employs about 65 . The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here . The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959 . Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock . The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928 . The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment . The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation . Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people . They export cotton ginning machinery . The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment '' . This includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin . The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the Mississippi Delta . The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here . They make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery . The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas . They've been in Dallas since 1921 . Cotton Belt Gin Service , Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago . They distribute equipment in 11 states . The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting , bearings , etc. . Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy . New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year . Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year . Totaling 3,399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963 . However , compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441 , this March was off 23 per cent . On a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744 . This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier . With the March pickup , dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year . The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter . On the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars . Only three standard models -- Buick , Chrysler , and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county . The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project . Now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship . Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields . More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis . Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T. Owens , national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp. of New York . The 33 honored students are : Mike Trigg , Raymond Arrington , and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams , Janice Whitney , Fil Terral , and Carl David Page of W. H. Adamson ; ; Bill Burke , Tommie Freeman , and Lawrence Paschall of N. R. Crozier Tech. Paulah Thompson , Gerald Kestner , and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest ; ; Arnold Hayes , Mary Ann Shay , and Lloyd Satterfield of Thomas Jefferson ; ; William Cluck , Deloris Carrel Carty , and Edna Earl Eaton of North Dallas ; ; Patricia Ann Neal , Johnny Carruthers , and David McLauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville ; ; David Wolverton , Sharon Flanagan , and James Weaver of W. W. Samuels ; ; William Austin , Gary Hammond , and Ronnie Davis of South Oak Cliff ; ; Bill Eaton , Carolyn Milton , and Ronnie Bert Stone of Sunset ; ; and Charles Potter , Ronnie Moore , and Robert Bailey of Woodrow Wilson . The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration , came under fire in Dallas last week . The Administration's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated Caron S. Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . Santa Barbara -- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' . He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . ' not flash in pan ' Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . `` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . Danger cited He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike . Sacrifices needed Draper declared , `` As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today . We must justify our heritage . We must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' . He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration , that `` Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' . He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' . While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro , `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere . Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that '' . New York ( AP ) -- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks . Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average . It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages . Some good news Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news . A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month . Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxes . The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87 . Of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined . New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 . Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day . Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday . A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American Marketing Assn. . However , Peterson , president of Bell & Howell , warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' . Creations needed `` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , Peterson said . `` With this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' . The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs . Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas . He cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology . He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market . Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange , effective Tuesday , has been announced by Thomas P. Phelan , president of the exchange . Taylor , president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co. , Beverly Hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925 . Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon , Read & Co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp. . Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to Union . Under the new offering , only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares . Due in 1986 The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures , due June 1 , 1986 , at 100% , and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 , 1991 , at 100% . The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1 , 1966 ; ; $70 by 1971 ; ; $75 by 1976 ; ; $80 by 1981 ; ; $85 by 1986 , and $90 thereafter . New York ( AP ) -- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled . Volume was 1.23 million shares , down from Monday's 1.58 million . Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic Foil . Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained 2-1/2 each . Question -- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8 , 1960 . Something has gone wrong some place . I am getting dividends on only 50 shares . In other words , I am getting only half the dividends I should . Answer -- Write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City , N.J. . That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund . The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things . But it seems that this `` electronic brain '' wasn't `` programmed '' correctly . This resulted in a great number of errors . And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders . I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation . At that time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand . They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days '' . That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts . Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected . Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank . Doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries . He selects queries or general interest to answer . Washington ( AP ) -- Alfred Hayes , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system . Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations , `` there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' . Washington ( UPI ) -- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge . Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect . The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj . `` All these kind of things weaken us '' , Perlman said . Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad . `` The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s '' , he told the hearing . C & O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case . The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B & Aj . Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger . The proposed C & O-B & O railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest . Washington ( AP ) -- The government's short-term borrowing costs rose with Tuesday's weekly offering of Treasury bills . On $1.1 billion of 90-day bills , the average yield was 2.325% . The rate a week ago was 2.295% . Washington , March 11 ( UPI ) . -- `` Consumer uncertain about economic conditions '' . This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center . Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . Increase expected The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference . It disclosed that the builders : Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts . The industry has said 1960 was a poor year . Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 . Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? Leaders of industry The reason , says the Housing Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . Elburn , Ill. -- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . We sold only four pickers all last year '' . Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . `` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . The higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . `` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. . For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . Two of three report gains Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . `` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa . `` This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . Last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; in August of 1960 , he sold seven . Dealers' stocks down With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports . Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president . With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . Net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July . Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling . The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . Such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . `` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the President said . Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S. . The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution . Requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show . In such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law . The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . The Tax Court rejected this view . It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . The Service has not said what its next step will be . Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled . The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances . Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage . She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . State briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area . Colorado has a 2% sales tax . Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax . The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent . The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales . The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities . Washington -- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported . The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion . April sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) . The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March . Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March . Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion . Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It's unlike me '' . In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . A favorite is Norman Norell , however . She likes his classic chemise . Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell , a black and white organdy and silk jersey . Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette . She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose . Balenciaga is her favorite European designer . `` I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress '' , she reminisces . `` I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion '' . Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens . Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent , Greer Garson was born in County Down , Ireland . Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles . Reared in England , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London . She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm . Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End . Among stage performances was a starring role in `` Golden Arrow '' directed by Noel Coward . It was during `` Old Music '' at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B. Mayer spotted her . After signing a motion-picture contract , she came to America and had `` Goodbye , Mr. Chips '' as her first assignment after a year's wait . Other triumphs include `` Random Harvest '' , `` Madame Curie '' , `` Pride and Prejudice '' , `` The Forsythe Saga '' and `` Mrs. Miniver '' ( which won her the Academy Award in 1943 ) . Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless . Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in `` Sunrise at Campobello '' . She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` Captain Brassbound's Conversion '' to `` Camille '' . She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London , a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states . She is adept at skeet shooting , trout fishing , Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology . She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts . She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations . Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico . Back in college , today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food . The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy . Last October he gave a public speech in Washington , D.C. entitled `` Are Women Here To Stay '' ? ? So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey , director of SMU's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef . He is apt to rear back and claim his rights . Ramsey , as SMU's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week . Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! ! He also dishes up 3,000 snacks . And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center , along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables . Ramsey , 6-3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says , `` I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook '' . He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to Aj . And you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line . What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ? `` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat '' , says Ramsey . So he hides the mayonnaise . And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments . What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ? `` Pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza '' , says the handsome food expert . `` Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' . Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman , Henry Cabot Lodge , the King of Morocco , Clement Atlee and other shiny characters . Once four Tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line . `` They aren't supposed to look at women , you know '' , Ramsey recalled . `` What with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard time '' . Chicken Cadillac Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest . Salt and pepper each breast . Dip in melted butter and roll in flour . Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan . Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown . Add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts . Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer . While this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter . Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts . Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes . ( Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac , says Ramsey . ) Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month . Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia . A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . The other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . Colorful , bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite . The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group , Composite . The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor . To bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage . Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile . The Vagabonds are `` on the road '' again . Members are on their way to Saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars . This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club , Saledo , for festivities . Invitations have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price Daniel . Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail . The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing . Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm Trail Days . Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women . The men will be in western attire , including Stetsons and colored vests . Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas , in tall bushes ; ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes . There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests . Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip . Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy McKee , George McElyee , Jack Fanning , W. H. Roquemore and Joe Darrow . The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto `` Go Somewhere , Anywhere , Everywhere '' . Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe . In the past , the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica , buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston . Four parties are given a year . Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity . Serving on the club's board are Mmes R. P. Anderson , president ; ; A. F. Schmalzried , secretary ; ; W. H. Roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : Mmes McKee , publicity ; ; Lawrence B. Jones , yearbook , and Sam Laughlin , scrapbook . A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . She lives in Wellsville , Mo. . Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . And the third time was the charm . She dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist . The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges . Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs. Norman Chandler , chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee , and Mr. Chandler . Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts . A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton Becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex . Foliage will glow at formal fall party Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening . More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring . Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William A. Thompson , Van Cott Niven , A. B. Cox , David Bricker , Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson . Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins , and J. Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson . Guests from across U.S. honor Dr. Swim When Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country . A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points . Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles . He started practice in 1917 , and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners . Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing . She put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in Budapest . Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles . Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna . There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . And there she had her first showing of tapestry work . There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today . What most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . Getting to and from school was no problem . They either walked or were driven . Now they go to a high school that is two miles away . One might think the problem would be similar . They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . It's much more complex than that . Generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . `` Why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? I suggested . `` My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois '' . `` Did you '' ? ? I was asked . `` No '' , I said , `` I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois '' . I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . I had to ride a streetcar two miles . Sometimes the streetcar was late . Sometimes there weren't even any seats . I had to stand up , with the ladies . Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . She has to have at least one car herself . I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . Even that isn't satisfactory . If they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . They say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . The logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself . The solution , naturally , is the bus . However , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . But that's hardly realistic . Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an education . Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week . Published annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman . Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . Stars for marriage Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year . Last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane Cooper , daughter of the Grant B. Coopers , to Robert Knox Worrell , and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard Pen Tudor . Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan McFarland Chandler Jr. ; ; Joanne Curry , daughter of the Ellsworth Currys , to James Hartley Gregg , and Valerie Smith to James McAlister Duque . Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning , daughter of the George L. Brownings , to Austin C. Smith Jr. ; ; Cynthia Flower , daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr. , to Todd Huntington , son of the David Huntingtons . Pasadena listings Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins 3 . She is the former Judy Chapman , daughter of John S. Chapman of this city . The young couple live in Pasadena . Another marriage of note is that of Jane McAlester and William Louis Pfau . Changes in address are noted . For instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly Rd. , are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills . Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd. . The Richard Beesemyers , formerly of Connecticut , have returned to Southern California and are now residing on South Arden Blvd. . But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their residence in Southern California for Mexico City . More new addresses Judge and Mrs. Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach , while the Frank Wangemans have moved from Beverly Hills to New York , where he is general manager of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . And Lawrence Chase , son of the Ransom Chases , is listed at his new address in Oxford , Eng. . Others listed at new addresses are the Richard T. Olerichs , the Joseph Aderholds Jr. , the Henri De La Chapelles , the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton Crispin , the John Armisteads , the Allen Chases , the Howard Lockies , the Thomas Lockies , and Anthony Longinotti . Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones , formerly of Panama ; ; the Geddes MacGregors , formerly of Scotland , and Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Althaus , formerly of Switzerland . Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L '' , the foot of the `` L '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . Pulling strings Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . In this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . The scalloped edge is particularly appealing . Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era . A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden . Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . Solid investment There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge . The Cumbancheros , Latin combo , open Tuesday at the Four O'Clock Club . `` Flip '' Phillips for a return engagement at Fireside Steak Ranch Wednesday ; ; same date , Johnny LaSalle trio to the Jolly Roger . Dick Carroll and his accordion ( which we now refer to as `` Freida '' ) held over at Bahia Cabana where `` Sir '' Judson Smith brings in his calypso capers Oct. 13 . Johnny Leighton picked up some new numbers out in Texas which he's springing on the ringsiders in the Rum House at Galt Ocean Mile Hotel . `` Skip '' Hovarter back in town from a summer in the Reno-Lake Tahoe area where he ran into Rusty Warren , Kay Martin , the Marskmen and Tune Toppers -- all pulling good biz , he says . We like Fike Al Fike , an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado , is currently pursuing the three R's -- rhythm , reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel . Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring . Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano , Wes Robbins , bass and trumpet , and Jack Kelly on drums . It's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie , it's Al's all the way . Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . He skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act . This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal . New owners Cafe Society opens formally this afternoon under its new ownership . George Kissak is the bossman ; ; Terry Barnes has been named manager .

The business education program operates with the cooperation of local high schools and business firms . Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ? More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church . At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged . A young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force . He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing . Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it . When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it . The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church . And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity . So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program . This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; ; a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; ; and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days , by Ted Place , director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ , and Jon Braun , director of Campus Crusade for Christ . The second half of the film `` Communism on the Map '' and the movie `` Operation Abolition '' also will be shown . Response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon . And to encourage other churches to try their own programs , Kern said this Sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations . The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week . Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter family , 3181 SW 24th Ter. , will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church . It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies . The first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life . `` When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows '' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class . Until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home . They have five daughters -- Coral Lee , 5 , Glenda Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months . But after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories . To their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part . Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her . Dade's chief probation officer , Jack Blanton , will lead a discussion on `` The Changes in the American Family '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church . Mr. and Mrs. George Treadwell will be honored at a Family Week supper and program at 6 p.m. Sunday at Trinity Methodist Church . He is the sexton of the church . A family worship service will follow the program at 7:45 p.m. . The outstanding family of Central Nazarene Church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10:45 a.m. Sunday service marking National Family Week . Every family of Riviera Presbyterian Church has been asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during National Christian Family Week and to undertake one project in which all members of the family participate . To start the week of special programs at the church , the Rev. John D. Henderson will preach on `` A Successful Marriage '' at 9:40 and 11 a.m. Sunday . New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service . A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men's Club will be held at 6:15 p.m. Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next Saturday . The week will end with the Rev. Mr. Henderson preaching on `` The Marriage Altar '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday , May 14 . The resignation of the Rev. Warren I. Densmore , headmaster of St. Stephen's Episcopal Day School in Coconut Grove , becomes effective July 15 . Enrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . In announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . This work is no favorite of mine . I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation . Precise The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it . These qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet . Oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov . This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics . But , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned . Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . Hit Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky . Vladilen Semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . The production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society . The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players . Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; annual members may attend for $16 . Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ) . Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut Street , San Francisco 9 . San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children . Fire Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen . Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year . They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association , at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16th Street and Roosevelt Way . From the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution . Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San Francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 . Requests must be mailed in by December 5 . Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin . President Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said , `` We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . After all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita '' . It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . If that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fell . After television , `` La Dolce Vita '' seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night . I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week . I believe TV watchers will be bored . `` La Dolce Vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western . Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet '' . There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip '' . There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . In another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater . Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull . Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall . What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! As A moral shocker it is a dud . But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film . The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly : `` This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . And when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .

It is very chic to drive foreign cars . With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back . You must also wear a car coat . The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive . But we couldn't really get along without it . `` Where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha '' ? ? Asked the gas station man . The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor . Gas station people are very debonair about small cars . When I drove a car with tail fins , I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases . My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth . This excellent foreign bomb takes only six . When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me . `` Tires OK ? ? Check the oil and water , sir ? ? '' They polished the windshield . They had a loving touch . The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank . `` What kind of car is it '' ? ? He asked gloomily . `` It is a British Austin , the smallest they make '' . `` Get much mileage '' ? ? `` About 35 '' . The gas station man sighed unhappily . `` What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? Crunch , that's all she wrote '' . `` I will die rich '' . `` That will be $1.80 '' , said the gas station man . `` The windshield looks pretty clean '' . Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! ! When I wheeled about , finned fore and aft , I was the darling of the doormen . Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely . With a small bomb , I tuck it between Cadillacs . ( The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself . High blood pressure can get the best of any of us . ) At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J. . Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . It is the AID's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . It will be painted to match the paneling in the room . The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project . Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators . Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston . President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C. . But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert . It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People '' to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House . She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her . As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner '' and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief '' . `` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them '' , President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl . After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said , `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States . `` This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House '' . As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston . `` The nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the President commented . Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District . Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff . Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . Henry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the `` Stars and Stripes Forever '' . Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring . He said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert . One of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . `` I was an art major in college '' , Miss Baldrige explained . `` I've been here so many times I couldn't count them '' . She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of education . Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's `` Alba Madonna '' and `` texture '' in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral . Everybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionist . Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard Bales . I'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy ' '' . Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards . In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century . A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra Angelico . The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 . They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order . The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple . A reception and tea followed . About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States . The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m. . A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington , one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria . The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . She accused him of ignoring her . He in turn told her she demanded too much . They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . Mary decided she had had enough . Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer . Family Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area . They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest them . For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . They are now working together toward solving their difficulties . John received a promotion in his firm . He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area . Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund . Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . For crucial encounter One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . Mr. Kennedy replied : `` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting . Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . Road to Vienna The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. . That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement . On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident . The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . Pre-inaugural position Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : `` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . Attitude flexible At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . Deadlock on tests The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future . Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies . The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable . Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week . Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . The Washington announcement said : `` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . The outlook The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . Other allies consulted There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . Mollusks are a case in point . The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . This is not an isolated example ; ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . `` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . Adequate compensation is indispensable . Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . The committee remains unresponsive . Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; it must play a game in which there never is a winner . The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . ( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . ( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . ( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . ( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . ) If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . The problem must be faced squarely . If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; but many against combining to raise it '' . Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . The courts shared the opinion of the employers . In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : `` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . It was most effective against trade unions . In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . The law could not suspend economics . Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company . The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . ( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? ) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . The nation the three-front war At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 1 ) Cuba . Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . `` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . `` That limit has now been reached '' . Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . 2 ) Laos . After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . `` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' . Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos . French & Indians . There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . `` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man . But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos . The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West . He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj . `` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' . Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day . The Congress turmoil in the House As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . Deadly deadlock . There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness . A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech . For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . Equal treatment . There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons . In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' . ) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple . `` Unconscionable '' ! ! He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! ! Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee . Threat of war . As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose . His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus . The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer . ( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? ) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash . But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . `` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader . `` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . Battle in the senate The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech . Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . Republicans last act Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration . One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . `` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . `` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . And that is just what happened on the last few holes . The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . Player was the first to feel its teeth . After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . He bogeyed the 10th . After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears . He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower . Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt . Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe . The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . End at seven Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 . His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer . More than a streak had ended . Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . Player won only one . But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer . He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 . Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami . When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . Instant rivalry On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . ( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe . ) On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . The boldness of champions Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . Bob Jones played that way . Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . This day Palmer had started first . As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . `` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . This is Baseball 1961 . This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge . In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . Double threat : Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real . After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs . After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 . Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them . To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish . All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record . In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . ) `` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox . `` It has to be easier with two of them . How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ? Roommates : Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' . But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 . Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) . The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together . Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport . The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium . Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris . As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) . To an extent , the two even look alike . Both have blue eyes and short blond hair . Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York . Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each . Light reading : Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' . Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . `` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ? A reporter asked Maris recently . `` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' . This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken . But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . `` See that kid '' ? ? He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . `` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's . I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' . Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . `` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone . I'm angry '' . By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man . Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you . Send me where I can play '' . ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. . ) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench . Play me '' . ( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series . ) `` That's the way I am '' , he says . `` I tell people what I think . If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . Idols' idols : One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . Maris's was Ted Williams . `` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . `` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ? `` Are you kidding '' ? ? Said Maris . `` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio . `` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . But DiMaggio never said a word . It crushed Mickey . He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' . Mantle has kept the vow . Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track . If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine . But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball . They try to play baseball the best they can . Each is a complete ballplayer . Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . ( `` One of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris '' . ) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed . They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . Mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( , fourth in the league , to for Maris so far this year ) . Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base . Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox . Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; Maris's throwing arm is stronger . Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run . With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season . ( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams . Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place . Appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment . In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . Something was needed to revive interest ; ; the something was the home run . Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law . Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory . Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each . The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles . Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots . Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . A few of these people are still around '' . Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways . At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. . Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate . The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while . The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics . Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making . To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A.A.U.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete of 1960 . As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.S. Open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year . Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix , Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination . `` I'm a slob '' , he announced . `` My taste is gaudy . I'm useless for anything but racing cars . I'm ruddy lazy , and I'm getting on in years . It gets so frustrating , but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing '' . Has Moss no stirling virtues ? ? `` I appreciate beauty '' . One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 . Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because `` I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future '' . Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : `` I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh . There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause . On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' . He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures . He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world . All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city . But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block . At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . Break in Georgia The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . `` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . Catch for Chicago When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . But they were not . They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; they put much effort into public housing . They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . But almost all the schools were primary . The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! '' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! ) . The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . It is hard to blame them for this . Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . There were four principal ones . First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . Confusion became chaos ; ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . '' Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . ( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . ) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . Lumumba fired Kasavubu . Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . The presidency : talking and listening Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . And that was not all . In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . Crime : ' skyjacked ' From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix . Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . `` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said . `` I figured he was sick '' . John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . `` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said . `` The other fellow had a '' . Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . Stalling : `` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; they would have to refuel at El Paso . Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . `` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . Tension The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : Take off or see the hostages killed . The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; the plane slowed to a halt . Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . The day wore on . At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . ( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . ) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' . Congress : more muscle Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . ( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . ) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . In other areas , Congressional action last week included : The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . Food : stew a la Mulligatawny Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . Tax-free returns . Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . Swelling traffic . A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . Slow successes . Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . That improvement is continuing . In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . Many rate increases already have been put into effect . Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . Easier access . Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . For some roads , troubles . Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . These , however , are exceptions . The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- `` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : `` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . About half of these are exported . `` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . `` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . `` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . `` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . `` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . `` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . `` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . It's an important clue to Washington thinking . Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . `` Get competitive or get out '' . In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . Government research will look into new products and methods . Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . They threaten to strike . The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . Some library boards are wary of the plan . A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . All services are given without cost to members . So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . The system passes on these savings to its members . Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . Books are not the only resource of the system . Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . The need for lifetime reading is apparent . Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; if we do not know how to use what we do read . We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . Only public understanding and support can provide that service . This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! !\""

            "the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr. . `` only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . the jury said it did find that many of georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . merger proposed however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . it urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . implementation of georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . it urged that the next legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . `` this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the state welfare department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county , which receives none of this money . the jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . `` failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on fulton taxpayers . the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . wards protected the jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee . `` these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . regarding atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . the jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . ask jail deputies on other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . ( 2 ) fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department , the fulton tax commissioner's office , the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms , grady hospital and the fulton health department . mayor william b. hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , pearl williams hartsfield , in fulton superior court friday . his petition charged mental cruelty . the couple was married aug. 2 , 1913 . they have a son , william berry jr. , and a daughter , mrs. j. m. cheshire of griffin . attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . the petition listed the mayor's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . it listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as opelika , ala. . the petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . the hartsfield home is at 637 e. pelham rd. aj . henry l. bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney . hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . the mayor's present term of office expires jan. 1 . he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr. , who became a candidate in the sept. 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said wednesday . robert snodgrass , state gop chairman , said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . state party chairman james w. dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept. 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen. john tower will be the featured speaker . in the blue ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to republicans who attended . when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . sam caldwell , state highway department public relations director , resigned tuesday to work for lt. gov. garland byrd's campaign . caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time . he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . when the gubernatorial campaign starts , caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd . the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . before adjournment monday afternoon , the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . gov. vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . construction bonds meanwhile , it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia's most heavily traveled highways . a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work . a revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov. marvin griffin . the highway department source told the constitution , however , that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . schley county rep. b. d. pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body's action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances . pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 . a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 . as of sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions . a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . rep. mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . but he added that none of georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . the resolution , which barber tossed into the house hopper friday , will be formally read monday . it says that `` in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the state board of education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . colquitt -- after a long , hot controversy , miller county has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election i ever saw in this county '' . the new school superintendent is harry davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated felix bush , a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee . davis received 1,119 votes in saturday's election , and bush got 402 . ordinary carey williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . `` this was the coolest , calmest election i ever saw '' , colquitt policeman tom williams said . `` being at the polls was just like being at church . i didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' . the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . it was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . the former county school superintendent , george p. callan , shot himself to death march 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . during the election campaign , both candidates , davis and bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . ordinary williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . `` everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . `` there wasn't a bit of trouble '' . austin , texas -- committee approval of gov. price daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers . daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures , in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation . under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug. 31 . he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since texas was a republic '' . it permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . the bill , which daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , daniel declared . dewey lawrence , a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . `` if you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . `` you take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . rep. charles e. hughes of sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . his contention was denied by several bankers , including scott hudson of sherman , gaynor b. jones of houston , j. b. brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin . cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last monday . austin , texas -- senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen. george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties . the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house . it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here . operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas , harris , bexar , tarrant and el paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , parkhouse told the senate . the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county , saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school . dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps. v. e. ( red ) berry and joe ratcliff . while details are still to be worked out , ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . `` we're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said ratcliff . `` but i believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . i'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . rep. berry , an ex-gambler from san antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . the house passed finally , and sent to the senate , a bill extending the state health department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . one validated acts of school districts . another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district . the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . without dissent , senators passed a bill by sen. a. r. schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district . money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . two tax revision bills were passed . one , by sen. louis crump of san saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league . the other bill , by sen. a. m. aikin jr. of paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by sen. frank owen 3 , of el paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . marshall formby of plainview , former chairman of the texas highway commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . under formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the house , attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court . austin , texas -- state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay . an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot , when texas votes on a u.s. senator . rep. wesley roberts of seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb. 22 . the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot , roberts said . opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . all dallas members voted with roberts , except rep. bill jones , who was absent . austin , texas -- paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas' big cities thursday . rep. james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise , a wise county hamlet of 250 people . when the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen. george parkhouse of dallas . most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen. parkhouse . the bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas . statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway cotten's attack . the bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like j. w. buchanan of dumas , eligio ( kika ) de la garza of mission , sam f. collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs . `` this is a poor boy's bill '' , said chapman . `` dallas and fort worth can vote bonds . this would help the little peanut districts '' . austin , texas -- a houston teacher , now serving in the legislature , proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . rep. henry c. grover , who teaches history in the houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . a normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . `` a person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or english , yet who has not taken education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said grover . college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses . fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as co-signers of the proposal . paris , texas ( sp. ) -- the board of regents of paris junior college has named dr. clarence charles clark of hays , kan. as the school's new president . dr. clark will succeed dr. j. r. mclemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . dr. clark holds an earned doctor of education degree from the university of oklahoma . he also received a master of science degree from texas a & i college and a bachelor of science degree from southwestern state college , weatherford , okla. . in addition , dr. clark has studied at rhode island state college and massachusetts institute of technology . during his college career , dr. clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . dr. clark has served as teacher and principal in oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at raymondville , texas , high school , as an instructor at the university of oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at fort hays , kan. , state college . he has served as a border patrolman and was in the signal corps of the u.s. army . denton , texas ( sp. ) -- principals of the 13 schools in the denton independent school district have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of supt. chester o. strickland . state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . the report , culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load . the report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and adc dependency '' . `` must solve problem '' the monthly cost of adc to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said c. virgil martin , president of carson pirie scott & co. , committee chairman . `` we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence '' , martin said . the volume of adc cases will decrease , martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . these , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc '' . calls for extension other recommendations made by the committee are : extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , judge james b. parsons was told in criminal court yesterday . the disclosure by charles bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client , alan clements , 30 , a separate trial . bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . fears prejudicial aspects `` the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , bellows told the court . `` some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ? `` yes , your honor '' , replied bellows . `` what this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . there is a conflict among the defendants '' . washington , july 24 -- president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio . the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone . shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port , mass. , a white house spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion . decisions are made asked to elaborate , pierre salinger , white house press secretary , replied , `` i would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' . salinger said the work president kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia's demands and proposals for the city . the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m. karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . he said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' . karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases . in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' . contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j. wexler , special prosecutor . issue jury subpoenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury . mayer goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation . wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning . karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' . he said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the criminal court processes . `` actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said karns , who is a city judge in east st. louis sitting in cook county court . faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons . wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another . the cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward . the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns . two other cases also were under advisement . claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them . washington , feb. 9 -- president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . the president , in a special message to congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . the aged care plan , similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on capitol hill . it was defeated in congress last year . cost up to $37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . the payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . both figures would go higher in later years . other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . these would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . 4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . `` this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . `` this is not a program of socialized medicine . it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . wouldn't pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills . they would still be paid by the patient . apart from the aged care plan the president's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . in addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . the president recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . more for nursing homes in the area of `` community health services '' , the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . he asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . in the child health field , the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . he did not say by how much . for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . the president said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . the president said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president's plan . those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . senate republican leader dirksen ( ill. ) and house republican leader charles halleck ( ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . house speaker sam rayburn ( d. , tex. ) called the kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the house . washington , feb. 9 -- acting hastily under white house pressure , the senate tonight confirmed robert c. weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . a number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . in the last eight years , all presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of sen. wayne morse ( d. , ore. ) in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961 . oslo the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . this has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . in oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . explosion avoided in the case of portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . the general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members' votes , since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance . canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive . even norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the nato line . on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . but he hastened to add that , if united states policies were not always clear , despite mr. rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited . the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite mr. rusk's personal popularity , that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . the secretary of state himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . but where the core of nato is concerned , the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at nato's disposal in european waters . the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . conflict surveyed the secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that east-west friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . this increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . washington the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos . the united states , state department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam . they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this . the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated . but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference . this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . but with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression ? ? former vice-president richard m. nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union . he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . gop restrained it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it . they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in cuba . one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the kennedy administration on this score . his reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b. morton ( r ) of kentucky , chairman of the republican national committee , that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination . kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard , boston university , brandeis , and massachusetts institute of technology educators . detente urged this group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups '' . it recommends that the united states `` seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . mr. nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation . but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated . until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos , almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by mr. nixon and the professors . aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . but thus far there has been no response in kind . foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . in laos , the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture . again and again it asked the communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in laos . but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate . and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization . seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos . but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over laos . ( some seato nations disagreed , however . ) there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , thailand and south viet nam . the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos . the pro-western government , which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army . there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the pro-western government to the hilt . if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . one factor was the statement of senator j. w. fulbright ( d ) of arkansas , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee . he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of prince souvanna . washington the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states . the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . in an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the president's committee on juvenile delinquency and crime , to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . offenses multiply the president has also called upon the attorney general , the secretary of health , education and welfare , and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l. hackett , a special assistant to the attorney general , as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime . his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , raymond h. hawksley , the present city cd head , believes . mr. hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . east providence now has no civil defense program . mr. hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time cd director in the city for the last nine years . he is not interested in being named a full-time director . noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , mr. hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . mr. hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time cd job . one of these men is former fire chief john a. laughlin , he said . along with a director , the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . mr. hawksley said . one advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . mr. hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station . he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area . speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , mr. hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in seekonk would be another . riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point . mr. hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . if the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time cd director , mr. hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . one of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly . the governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r. grant , deputy city clerk of central falls . a copy was released to the press . mr. notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant . the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review , mr. notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty. gen. j. joseph nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . he will then appoint the study committee with mr. nugent's cooperation , the governor said . `` i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , mr. notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales '' . the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws . the statutes , similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath . the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday . the only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday '' , the council's resolution said . the small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . it declares that sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . the council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on sunday . they `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , george h. reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . mr. reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheraton-biltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . he said he was `` confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910 '' . that , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . `` that was before i studied law . some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party . the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track . he steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . mr. reama , who retired as vice president of the american screw co. in 1955 said , `` both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . he said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , mr. reama said : `` a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . mr. reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . william a. martinelli , chairman of the citizens group of johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr. . the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr. martinelli happens to hold that post . mr. martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . a difference of opinion arose between mr. martinelli and john p. bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . mr. martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while mr. bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . mr. bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . he assured mr. martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . mr. martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . `` after inspiring this , i think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . `` it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement '' . he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . `` our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september . some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system . action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at monday's special north providence town council meeting . council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a. abatuno to draft the ordinance . at the last session of the general assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition . local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . plainfield -- james p. mitchell and sen. walter h. jones r-bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j. hughes , democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the gop is `` campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism '' . mitchell was for using it , jones against , and sen. wayne dumont jr. r-warren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel . the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club . it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of women's clubs . hughes said monday , `` it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired . now he's gone , the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . sunday he had added , `` we can love eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership '' . mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . `` how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? he asked . the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue . regrets attack jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . `` he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes' remark . dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . state aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority , and making new jersey attractive to new industry . decries joblessness mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republican-controlled state senate `` must share the blame for this '' . noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . `` but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , mitchell said . jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for mitchell . he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises . `` he calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , jones said . the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . defends ike earlier , mitchell said in a statement : `` i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j. hughes . his reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . `` i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . `` such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . it can only rebound to mr. hughes' discredit '' . sees jones ahead sen. charles w. sandman , r-cape may , said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . sandman , state campaign chairman for jones , was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel , newark , of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones . sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . sandman said : `` the announcement that sen. clifford case aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr. mitchell is a dead giveaway . it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jersey's problems . `` we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr. mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington . that failed . `` we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr. mitchell some of the glow of sen. case's candidacy of last year . that , too , will fail '' . sandman announced the appointment of mrs. harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave. , westfield , as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee . mrs. greenfield is president of the westfield women's republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman . county supervisor weldon r. sheets , who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . the proposal , sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january , 1964 . although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . the candidacy of mayor james j. sheeran of west orange , for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county , was supported today by edward w. roos , west orange public safety commissioner . sheeran , a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organization's candidate , freeholder william macdonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy , now a member of the state board of tax appeals . `` my experience as public safety commissioner '' , roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . jim sheeran fits that description '' . trenton -- william j. seidel , state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development , has retired after 36 years of service . a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a. bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . in october 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section . under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . he is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in

with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' . he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn : `` when i come back here after the november election you'll think , ' you're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' . he said , `` we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time '' . attacks republicans in his only attack on the republicans , hughes said , `` the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . but we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . we'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson . `` we'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november '' . he said , `` you can see signs of the republicans' feeble attack on the meyner administration . but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' . he urged new jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy '' . he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . `` we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean '' , the former superior court judge said . `` to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s '' . calling the democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people '' , hughes asked , `` a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november '' . hughes supported gov. meyner's `` green acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . he said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday . conservation plan the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state . the other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . hughes said , `` this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it '' , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . he said `` morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve '' . hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved . he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans . `` after the primary '' , he promised , `` i'll be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . i'm not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee '' . trenton -- fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . the outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters . a special presentation was made to mrs. geraldine thompson of red bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment . she served one four-year term on the national committee . resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r. screvane and abraham d. beame as running mates . at the same time reaction among anti-organization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . some anti-organization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr. wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . opposition reported some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr. wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept. 7 democratic primary . these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr. wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city . their view is that last-minute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor . in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , mr. wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a. buckley , the bronx democratic leader , and with joseph t. sharkey , the brooklyn democratic leader . mayor visits buckley as usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g. de sapio , the manhattan leader . he is publicly on record as believing mr. de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . last night the mayor visited mr. buckley at the bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . apparently he believes mr. buckley holds the key to the democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . in talks with mr. buckley last week in washington , the mayor apparently received the bronx leader's assent to dropping controller lawrence e. gerosa , who lives in the bronx , from this year's ticket . but mr. buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr. gerosa's successor . screvane and beame hailed the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr. screvane , who lives in queens , to replace abe stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for president of the city council and mr. beame , who lives in brooklyn , to replace mr. gerosa as the candidate for controller . the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx . after his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's new york times . the mayor said : `` it didn't come from me . but as i have said before , if i announce my candidacy , i will have something definite to say about running mates '' . boston , june 16 -- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts . there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . `` it's ' see joe , see jim ' '' , he says . `` the hand is out '' . a political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin o'connor's novel , `` the last hurrah '' . but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations . and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in massachusetts public life . day after day some new episode is reported . the state public works department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . washington , june 18 -- congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . in the senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . in the house , the southern-republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . the housing bill is now in the house rules committee . it is expected to be reported out tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . the panel's action depends on the return of representative james w. trimble , democrat of arkansas , who has been siding with speaker sam rayburn's forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor . mr. trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday . leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans . the democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . the $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last monday by the senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee , where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy . they are james j. delaney of queens and thomas p. o'neill jr. of massachusetts . three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958 . this would provide for long-term federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . mr. delaney and mr. o'neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee . about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . in the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , gordon boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a washington interview . six of these were proposed by religious groups . they will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in southeast asia , africa , the middle east and latin america . question raised interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . there are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . when he protested , the hotel owner said : `` why do you worry ? ? the u. s. government is paying for it . the u. s. government pays for all its overseas workers '' . missionary explains `` i don't work for the government '' , the american said . `` i'm a missionary '' . the hotel owner shrugged . `` same thing '' , he said . and then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? r. sargent shriver jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . no religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . moscow , june 18 -- at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia , premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : `` look , he took everything i had '' ! ! mr. khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker . indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of asia , africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid . the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . the communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to western estimates . this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 . in 1960 more than 6,000 communist technicians were present in those countries . united nations , n. y. , june 18 -- a committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations . this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations . one effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india . india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations . formula is due this week the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week . the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start . each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point . geneva , june 18 -- the three leaders of laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . the decision was made in zurich by prince boun oum , premier of the pro-western royal government ; ; prince souvanna phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as premier by the communist bloc , and prince souphanouvong , head of the pro-communist pathet lao forces . the latter two are half-brothers . their joint statement was welcomed by the western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of laos . an agreement among the princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded . but no one was overly optimistic . tactics studied in geneva w. averell harriman of the united states , malcolm macdonald of britain , maurice couve de murville , france's foreign minister , and howard c. green , canada's minister of external affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . the pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week . princess moune , prince souvanna phouma's young daughter , read the princes' statement . they had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she said . the three laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days . to deal with principles the meetings in zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government . appointment of william s. pfaff jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of the times-picayune publishing company was announced saturday by john f. tims , president of the company . pfaff succeeds martin burke , who resigned . the new promotion manager has been employed by the company since january , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . he is a native of new orleans and attended allen elementary school , fortier high school and soule business college . from june , 1942 , until december , 1945 , pfaff served in the army air corps . while in the service he attended radio school at scott field in belleville , ill. . before entering the service , pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in new orleans . he is married to the former audrey knecht and has a daughter , karol , 13 . they reside at 4911 miles dr. . washington -- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan. 20 . assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f. kennedy and retiring president dwight d. eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . pennsylvania avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint . but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the united states government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . of course , 1600 pennsylvania , the white house , is the most famous address of the free world . within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . seats on square along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . also the department of justice building is located where j. edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square , opposite the white house . in this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen. andrew jackson , hero of the battle of new orleans . moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units . about 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . division one of the parade will be the service academies . division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas , the respective states of the president and of vice-president l. b. johnson . then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union . division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states ; ; division four will be headed by the navy , followed by 11 states ; ; division five , by the air force followed by 11 states . division six will be headed by the coast guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , puerto rico , the virgin islands , guam , american samoa , the trust territories and the canal zone . jackson , miss. -- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi ? ? even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- gov. ross barnett . barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year . could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . if barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session . the odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . with eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic delta district , and congressman frank e. smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature . mississippi's relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house . split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck . and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . future clouded barnett , as the titular head of the democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . with a democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election . now , the picture is clouded , and even us sens. james o. eastland and john c. stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . baton rouge , la. -- the gov. jimmie h. davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . legislators weary indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . the administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes . davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy . if it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . he could terminate special sessions of the legislature . actually , davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . they would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition . he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . but if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma . since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . constant problem in either case , it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . it is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature . this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . the new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . shortcuts unnoticed hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . the hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , hemphill said . the controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday : the city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract . the philadelphia transportation co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . the signature of harold v. varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . managing director donald c. wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959 . concern bankrupt the hughes company and the consolidated industries , inc. , both of 3646 n. 2d st. , filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law . on monday , the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c. crumlish , jr. . intervenes in case the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms . travelers indemnity co. and the continental casualty co. . at berger's direction , the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u. s. district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . `` i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , berger said . the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track . the contract called for overhauling of 102 joints . the city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , hemphill charged . wide range in bids hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint . the bid from a. belanger and sons of cambridge , mass. , which listed the same officers as hughes , was $600 per joint . but , hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint . berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference . wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the hughes company . `` we won't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , wagner said . `` we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , berger said . wagner replied , `` can't you just see the headline : ' city hooked for $172,000 ' '' ? ? ' know enough to sue ' berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . douglas m. pratt , president of the ptc , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el . `` we want to find out who knew about it '' , pratt said . `` certain people must have known about it '' . `` the ptc is investigating the whole matter '' , pratt said . samuel d. goodis , representing the philadelphia hotel association , objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year . goodis voiced his objection before city council's finance committee . for hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , goodis said . testifies at hearing his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services . the new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that . the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room . the cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 . goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels . revenue estimated the city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year . the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan , spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses . a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs . the ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog . commissioner replies mrs. knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care . in reply , deputy police commissioner howard r. leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees . he reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the women's s.p.c.a. ; ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites . backs higher fees city finance director richard j. mcconnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year . the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said . the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a. gillis . petitions asking for a jail term for norristown attorney julian w. barnard will be presented to the montgomery county court friday , it was disclosed tuesday by horace a. davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last nov. 1 by barnard's hit-run car . the petitions will be presented in open court to president judge william f. dannehower , davenport said . barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by judge warren k. hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time . he was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning . victim of the accident was robert lee stansbery , 39 . his widow started the circulation of petitions after barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation . the city planning commission on tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the redevelopment authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 eastwick redevelopment area project . the commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project . one of the agreements calls for the new eastwick corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 . the tract is bounded by island ave. , dicks ave. , 61st st. , and eastwick ave. . four parks planned it is designated as stage 1 residential on the redevelopment authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores . the corporation was formed by the reynolds metal co. and the samuel a. and henry a. berger firm , a philadelphia builder , for work in the project . the second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of stage 1 residential to philadelphia builders eastwick corp. , a firm composed of 10 philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project . would bar vehicles the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was

left home for work . battalion chief stanton m. gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles . he was in baptist memorial hospital . ignition sets off blast the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work . `` i'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and i was lying on the driveway '' , he said . gladden's wife and two of his sons , john , 17 , and jim , 13 , were inside the house . the younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall . hood flies over house the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house . the left front wheel landed 100 feet away . police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either tnt or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel . it was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter . gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night . the fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union . led fight on teamsters gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 . the fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing . a $500 reward was offered by the association's local in kansas city , kas. . the association said it would post 24 hour guards at gladden's home and at those of james mining and eugene shiflett . mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and shiflett is a member of its executive committee . both have been active in the association . ankara , turkey , oct. 24 ( ap ) -- turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen. cemal gursel as president . an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat . by-passing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by gen. cedvet sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government . the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen. gursel as president . gen. gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months . the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned . party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own . vincent g. ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced monday by charles e. raymond , district attorney . ierulli will replace desmond d. connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by march 31 . ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in portland since november , 1959 . he is a graduate of portland university and the northwestern college of law . he is married and the father of three children . helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , e. m. martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night . martin , who has been in office in washington , d. c. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the multnomah hotel . he told some 350 persons that the united states' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . `` we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the soviet union . he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up '' . martin called for patience on the part of americans . `` the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build '' , he said . by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . individual help best `` we have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient '' , the assistant secretary said . economically , martin said , the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost '' . martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack . but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . the board members , after hearing the coordination plea from mrs. ralph h. molvar , 1409 sw maplecrest dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . chairman c. richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . dr. melvin w. barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful '' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . `` los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster '' , he said . `` nobody really expects to evacuate . i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . mrs. molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand '' , said , `` we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' . dr. barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' . mrs. molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowe's program . the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done . salem ( ap ) -- the statewide meeting of war mothers tuesday in salem will hear a greeting from gov. mark hatfield . hatfield also is scheduled to hold a public united nations day reception in the

bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in january . last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system . board members indicated monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools . secretary of labor arthur goldberg will speak sunday night at the masonic temple at a $25-a-plate dinner

to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god , in session at the memorial coliseum . the council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . the changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible . the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible . at the adoption , the rev. t. f. zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' . new point added many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : `` the scriptures , both old and new testament , are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' . the third belief , in six points , emphasizes the diety of the lord jesus christ , and : -- emphasizes the virgin birth -- the sinless life of christ -- his miracles -- his substitutionary work on the cross -- his bodily resurrection from the dead -- and his exaltation to the right hand of god . super again elected friday afternoon the rev. t. f. zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of assemblies of god . his offices are in springfield , mo. . election came on the nominating ballot . friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , `` breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . in his opening address wednesday the rev. mr. zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with `` breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years . the rev. r. l. brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work . `` surveys show that one out of three americans has vital contact with the church . this means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life '' , he told delegates friday . church loses pace talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the united states every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' . `` in 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches '' , the rev. mr. brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . `` in this light we need 1,000 churches in illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 800 in southern new england , we have 60 ; ; we need 100 in rhode island , we have none '' , he said . to step up the denomination's program , the rev. mr. brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years . to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . ' church meets change ' `` the church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' . a capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- encouraging by every means , all existing assemblies of god churches to start new churches . -- engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . -- surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . -- arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . u.s. dist. judge charles l. powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portland's insurance fraud trial . denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . in denying motions for dismissal , judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' . attorney dwight l. schwab , in behalf of defendant philip weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy , but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . proof lack charged schwab also declared there is no proof of weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the u.s. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor a. lawrence burbank replied : `` it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the u.s. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out '' . in the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case . miami , fla. , march 17 -- the orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen major-league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the kansas city athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . siebern hits homer over the first five frames , jack fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant , held the a's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . then dick hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . a two-run homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . house throws wild with one down in the eighth , marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle . catcher frank house's throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt . then heywood sullivan , kansas city catcher , singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the a's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser , a wild pitch , and frank cipriani's single under shortstop jerry adair's glove into center . the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers . three were doubles , brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one . hartman impressive bill kunkel , bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium . the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth . hartman , purchased by the a's from the milwaukee braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally . robinson doubles again in the ninth , robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . whitey herzog , performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked keegan for a base on balls . then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . pete ward was sent in for house and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to howser on the grass back of short . john powell , batting for adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and buddy barker , up for stepanovich , bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding , along with robinson , the two birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on russ snyder's single to right and crossed on kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . lumpe errs jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberry's head brandt took third and gentile second on the error . then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , tuttle to andy carey . the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this : lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . carey singles carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . then throneberry rapped into a fast double play . breeding to adair to gentile , setting up tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon . miami , fla. , march 17 -- the flavor of baltimore's florida grapefruit league news ripened considerably late today when the orioles were advised that ron hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . hansen , who slugged the 1960 oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a freshman average , completes the birds' spring squad at 49 players . the big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 american league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to kansas city -- the winless birds' sixth setback in a row . 15 pounds lighter the 6-foot 3-inch hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . he hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the flock breaks camp three weeks hence . when he was inducted into the army at fort knox , ky. , hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . `` i feel good physically '' , hansen added , `` but i think i'll move better carrying a little less weight than i'm carrying now '' . seeks `` improved fielding '' the rangy , albany ( cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . `` i think i can do a better job with the glove , now that i know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . hansen will engage in his first workout at miami stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the new york yankees . skinny brown and hoyt wilhelm , the flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the american league champions in tomorrow's 8 p.m. contest . duren , sheldon on hill ryne duren and roland sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the yanks' auburn ( n.y. ) farm club of the class-d new york-pennsylvania league , are the probable rival pitchers . twenty-one-year-old milt pappas and jerry walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the oriole mound chores against the bombers' art ditmar in sunday's 2 p.m. encounter . ralph houk , successor to casey stengel at the yankee helm , plans to bring the entire new york squad here from st. petersburg , including joe dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . the famed yankee clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . squad cut near pitcher steve barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at fort knox , ky. . the 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did hansen . baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as manager paul richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . `` take a ride on this one '' , brooks robinson greeted hansen as the bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . it was the first of two doubles by robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . just before game time , robinson's pretty wife , connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . unfortunately , brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three kansas city rookie hurlers . hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with lee macphail ; ; j. a. w. iglehart , chairman of the oriole board of directors , and public relations director jack dunn . their flight was delayed , dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . ex-oriole clint courtney , now catching for the a's is all for the american league's 1961 expansion to the west coast . `` but they shouldda brought in tokyo , too '' , added old scrapiron . `` then we'd really have someplace to go '' . bowie , md. , march 17 -- gaining her second straight victory , norman b. , small , jr.'s garden fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 st. patrick's day purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . toying with her field in the early stages , garden fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by jockey philip grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 8,280 attend races richard m. forbes's paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of glen t. hallowell's milties miss . a bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 st. patty day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice james p. verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on wednesday . culmone gets first win garden fresh , the result of a mating of better self and rosy fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the st. patrick's day purse with some speed in reserve . she was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . cleveland , march 17 ( ap ) -- george kerr , the swift-striding jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the knights of columbus track meet tonight , beating purdue's dave mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in new york with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out mills's early pace and beat the young big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by mal whitfield . mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . then kerr , a graduate student from illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off mills's challenge on the final turn . mills was timed in 1.10.4 . the crowd at the twenty-first annual k. of c. games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . mrs. grace butcher , of nearby chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . she snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by helen shipley , of wellsley college , in the national a.a.u. meet in columbus , ohio . san francisco , march 17 ( ap ) -- bobby waters of sylvania , ga. , relief quarterback for the san francisco 49ers of the national football league , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at franklin hospital here . waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . while working out in sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . st. petersburg , fla. , march 17 ( ap ) -- two errors by new york yankee shortstop tony kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the chicago white sox today . austin , texas -- a texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , eldon moritz , ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games . time stands still every time moritz , a 26-year-old army signal corps veteran , goes into the field . although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every saturday , in fact -- out of football . moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl . that's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state . moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . a 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from stamford , moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . `` this year , coach royal told me if i'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said moritz . `` so i started practicing on it in spring training . moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . moritz said monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . he kicked several while playing at stamford high school , including one that beat anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . `` i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . i never did miss one in a playoff game -- i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . his statistical record that year , when texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . he went into the army in march , 1957 , and returned two years later . but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . place kicking is largely a matter of timing , moritz declared . `` once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . i've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . practice helps you to get your timing down . `` it's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session . `` if you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . footnotes : in their first three games , the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the washington state game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists he'll be ready for oklahoma . last week , when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : `` that won't last long '' . it didn't ; ; monday , he had four longhorns in the top four . a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday , but attention quickly turned from saturday's victory to next week's problem : rice university . the mustangs don't play this week . `` we're just real happy for the players '' , coach bill meek said of the 9-7 victory over the air force academy . `` i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . it was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' . assistant coach john cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , i think , on the part of the coaches and the players . we needed it and we got it '' . meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon . both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . `` nelson played magnificent football '' , meek praised . `` he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . he broke that boy ( air force fullback nick arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . one was on a fourth-down screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannon's territory . `` as soon as it started to form , gannon spotted it '' , meek said . `` he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback terry isaacson ) had time to turn around . he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . the air force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . `` he just lay back there and waited for it '' , meek said . `` he almost brought it back all the way '' . except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice , meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice . `` kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game '' , meek said . `` he'll be out of action all this week . he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland . `` he's looking a lot better , and he's able to run '' , meek explained . `` we'll let him do a lot of running this week , but i don't know if he'll be able to play '' . the game players saw the air force film monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . `` we'll work hard tuesday , wednesday and thursday '' , meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage friday . we'll work out about an hour on saturday , then we'll work monday and tuesday of next week , then taper off '' . smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday , oct. 21 . huddle hearsay -- held out of texas tech's sweat-suits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders' 38-7 loss to texas a & m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday , baylor worked out in the rain monday -- mud or no mud . end gene raesz , who broke a hand in the owl's game with lsu , was back working out with rice monday , and john nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury . the texas aggies got a day off monday -- a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night , but myers announced that halfback george hargett , shaken up in the tech game , would not play against trinity saturday . halfback bud priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined tcu's workout monday . the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the denver broncos -- but their visit will be a short one . the texans have two more road games -- at buffalo and houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach hank stram's men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . buffalo coach buster ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-national football leaguers , m. c. reynolds and warren rabb . rabb , the former louisiana state field general , came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the houston oilers , defending league champions . `` just our luck '' ! ! exclaimed stram . `` buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver , and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , jack spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . `` our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . `` in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . the texans won the game through ball control , with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes . `` we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained stram . `` they can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans , but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes , the flashy halfback . he was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denver's al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas . a quick touchdown resulted . `` that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said stram , quipping , `` i think i'll put that play in the book '' . the early southwest conference football leaders -- texas , arkansas and texas a & m -- made a big dent in the statistics last week . texas' 545-yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new swc high . arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip tcu , and a & m , with a 38-point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to baylor's 126 ) , but idle baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to texas' 189 ) . a & m has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology . rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis , 5-3 . the husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area . it was nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies' winning streak to four straight . they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack . nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning . he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . the bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in sunday's opener , and never lagged . dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bear's attack . after al paschal gruonded out , jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe . alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left . jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don wert's smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout . the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzer's glove . nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies . the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusik's double and outfield flies by porter and wert . gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth . despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . bingles and bobbles : cliff cook accounted for three of the tribe's eight hits . it was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ . among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , patti waggin who is mrs. don rudolph when off the stage . lefty wyman carey , another denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 o'clock tuesday night . ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . dallas , tex. , may 1 -- ( ap ) -- kenny lane of muskegon , mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler , tex. , here monday night . st. paul-minneapolis , may 1 -- ( ap ) -- billy gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field , drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 6-5 victory over the chicago white sox monday . lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . he came all the way around on gardner's hit before 5777 fans . it was gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . turk lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while ray moore won his second game against a single loss . the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny green's double to left . the white sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . jim landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 1-0 lead , but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard . al smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front . a double by green , allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by lemon and gardner's solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth . ogden , utah , may 1 -- ( ap ) -- boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball . `` i've had it '' , he told a newsman . `` i know when my reflexes are gone and i'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' . this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout . jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno , nev. , where his wife , former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen , awaited . she said , when she learned jackie was heading home : `` i'm just speculating , but i have to think jack feels he's hurting boston's chances '' . the union pacific railroad streamliner , city of san francisco , stopped in ogden , utah , for a few minutes . sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . the conductor said to ritchie : `` i don't think you want to talk to him . you'll probably get a ball bat on the head . he's mad at the world '' . but jackie had gone into the station . ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . `` i told him who i was and he was quite cold . but he warmed up after a while . i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( liston ) got was through a keyhole . he said he had never talked to liston '' . liston is bill liston , baseball writer for the boston traveler , who quoted jensen as saying : `` i can't hit anymore . i can't run . i can't throw . suddenly my reflexes are gone . just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . and so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old warren spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the giants and the giants' willie mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree sunday . both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` wish i was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . yes , with bob grove , carl hubbell , herb pennock , art nehf , vernon gomez , et al . spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . `` spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked enos slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . the spectacular mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyn's ebbetts field . ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies , the braves' joe adcock , lou gehrig of the yankees , pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito , then with cleveland , made their history on the road . willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle . this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an american or national fan and anti or pro-yankee . the record books , however , would favor the giants' ace . in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . once the figure was 30-30 . willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickey's . the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukee's park . it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . the denver-area tv audience was privileged to see mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home . this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the `` living room athletic club '' when games were cut off . actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . this year , i am told , the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here . there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy . this dissatisfaction led to howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . cincinnati , ohio ( ap ) -- the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed cincinnati , crushing the reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage monday in the loosely played finale . with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries , the american league champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . johnny blanchard , mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5-run first inning . hector lopez , subbing for berra , smashed a 3-run homer off bill henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors . the crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . momentarily the reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . in the fifth , wally post slashed a 2-run homer off bud daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter . the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager . only bucky harris , the `` boy-manager '' of washington in 1924 , and eddie dyer of the st. louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . philadelphia , jan. 23 -- nick skorich , the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles , was elevated today to head coach . skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . he succeeds buck shaw , who retired at the end of last season . the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaw's staff -- jerry williams and charlie gauer . williams is a defensive coach . gauer works with the ends . choice was expected the selection had been expected . skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings , the newest national football league entry . van brocklin , the quarterback who led the eagles to the title , was signed by the vikings last wednesday . philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . with skorich at the helm , the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . in the past the club depended largely on van brocklin's aerials . skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . coach played 3 years skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at cincinnati university and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers . an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season . he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949 . he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy , n. y. . he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach . four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers . the eagles signed him for shaw's staff in 1959 . skorich began his new job auspiciously today . at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth , the eagles were honored for winning the championship . shaw and skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . with the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to william a. ( ( bill ) shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the new york chapter , baseball writers' association of america , at the waldorf-astoria hotel . shea , the chairman of mayor wagner's baseball committee , will be joined on the dais by warren spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the milwaukee braves ; ; frank graham , the journal-american sports columnist ; ; bill mazeroski , the world series hero of the pittsburgh pirates , and casey stengel , the former manager of the yankees . stengel will receive the ben epstein good guy award . mazeroski , whose homer beat the yankees in the final series game , will receive the babe ruth award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the william j. slocum memorial award . to spahn will go the sid mercer memorial award as the chapter's player of the year . show follows ceremonies a crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . the 53-year-old shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york . named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a. farley , bernard gimbel and clint blume , shea worked relentlessly . his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city . the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees . despite countless barriers and disappointments , shea moved forward . when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another national league club to move here . when that failed , he enlisted branch rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the continental , with new york as the key franchise . the continental league never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . flushing stadium in works the new york franchise is headed by mrs. charles shipman payson . a big-league municipal stadium at flushing meadow park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by commissioner ford c. frick . shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . shea and his wife , nori , make their home at sands point , l. i. . bill jr. , 20 , kathy , 15 , and patricia , 9 , round out the shea family . shea was born in manhattan . he attended new york university before switching to georgetown university in washington . he played basketball there while working toward a law degree . later , shea owned and operated the long island indians , a minor league professional football team . he was the lawyer for ted collins' old boston yankees in the national football league . all was quiet in the office of the yankees and the local national leaguers yesterday . on friday , roger maris , the yankee outfielder and winner of the american league's most-valuable-player award , will meet with roy hamey , the general manager . maris is in line for a big raise . arnold palmer and sam snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the metropolitan golf writers association tonight . the dinner will be held at the hotel pierre . palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and snead will be saluted as the winning team in the canada cup matches last june in dublin . deane beman , the national amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including bob gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . the writers' gold tee award will go to john mcauliffe of plainfield , n. j. , and palm beach , fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . horton smith of detroit , a former president of the professional golfers association , will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington , democrat of missouri . golf's golden boy arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . he won the masters , the united states open and a record $80,738 in prize money . he was heralded as `` sportsman of the year '' by sports illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the `` professional athlete of the year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded hickok belt . but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . a couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . it made him human . and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . it was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold . he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . the world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . he boomed a 280-yard drive . then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . no margin for error on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , arnold whipped into his second shot . the ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . `` it is possible that i over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . so he wound up with a dozen . `` it was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . from the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open . the idol of the hackers , of course , is ray ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the united states open . their secondary hero is another pro , willie chisholm , who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . willie's partner was long jim barnes , who tried to keep count . stickler for rules `` how many is that , jim '' ? ? asked willie at one stage of his excavation project . `` thirteen '' , said long jim . `` nae , man '' , said willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . he had a 16 . palmer's dozen were honestly earned . nor were there any rules to save him . if there had been , he would have found a loophole , because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . this knowledge has come in handy , too . his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . the ball floated downstream . a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . arnold sent for joe dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` i knew it all along '' , confessed arnold with a grin , `` but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . he'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . that's how he first won the masters in 1958 . it happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . ruling from on high `` i can remove the ball , can't i '' ? ? asked palmer of an official . `` no '' , said the official . `` you must play it where it lies '' . `` you're wrong '' , said arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` i'll do as you say , but i'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . he scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . the golfing fathers ruled in his favor . so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . until a few weeks ago , however , arnold palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today . other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . the owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . however , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . pete rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : `` we'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies , they won't be misled by the pirates' slower start this season . `` pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , mauch said here the other day . `` the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . they have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season , along with bobby shantz '' . tonight at 8 o'clock the cardinals , who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . the pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the redbirds are 7-9 . change in pitchers . solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from bob gibson to ernie broglio , for several reasons : 1 broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 3 the redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the phillies sunday . manager hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment . after thursday's open date , solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night . harvey haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonight's game at busch stadium . boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . haddix has a 13-8 record against the redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadn't decided between mizell and vern law for wednesday's game . mizell has won both of his starts . nieman kept in lineup . after a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the giants . `` i have to stay with nieman for a while '' , hemus said . `` bill white ( sore ankles ) should be ready . with a lefthander going for pittsburgh , i may use don taussig in center '' . `` lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , hemus said . `` he should be getting back in the groove before long . our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice , but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday . six bucks over . until the bucs' bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . despite the recession , pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : smoky burgess , gino cimoli , bill virdon , bob clemente and dick groat , each , dick stuart , don hoak and bob skinner . bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet . perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend , who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs . friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . `` we're getting friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , murtaugh said . `` virdon has been blasting the ball . no plunkers for him '' . six bucs over . the pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by may 1 last year , when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season . on last may 1 , the cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . in 1958 , the birds were 3-10 on may 1 . a year later they were 4-13 . since 1949 , the st. louis club has been below on may 1 just four times . the '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories . the '52 cards were 6-7 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . then last season the birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . since 1949 , the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 dodger team . those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by may 8 . the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new york's '51 giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . they honored the battling billikens last night . speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st. louis university players who , in the words of coach john benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than i did '' . the most valuable player award was split three ways , among glen mankowski , gordon hartweger and tom kieffer . in addition , a special award was given to bob ( bevo ) nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . `` you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . the boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do . `` several times i found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . we'd be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say , ' don't worry , coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . the trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by bob broeg , sports editor of the post-dispatch . kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against bradley in st. louis u.'s nationally televised victory . benington said , `` i've never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day '' . benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . after the coach listed all the boy's faults , hartweger said , `` coach before i leave here , you'll get to like me '' . mrs. benington admired gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . as hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` i want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . bob burnes , sports editor of the globe-democrat , presented bob nordmann with his award . bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . within a week after the injury , suffered in st. louis's victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament , nordmann was sitting on the bill's bench doing what he could to help benington . on the clock given him was the inscription , `` for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball , 1960-61 '' . other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the national invitation tournament were : art hambric , donnell reid , bill nordmann , dave harris , dave luechtefeld and george latinovich . `` this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , benington pointed out . `` by winning against bradley , kentucky and notre dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . st. louis university found a way to win a baseball game . larry scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in billiken baseball history , as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college , 5-1 , at crystal city . the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie . the tie was against southeast missouri last friday . scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , len boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple . st. louis u. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field . the game opened a busy week for washington . the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy , ill. , saturday . happy hitting if it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? the two top talents of the time , mickey mantle and willie mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . and that's meant as a boost , not a knock . mays and mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . their heights , that is . mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the american league in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . like the yankees' slugger , mays , the terror of the giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- willie . his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . now , apparently happier under new managers , mays and mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . labor relations yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . the truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . for that matter , stan musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . mantle , it's apparent , resented casey stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . the old man was almost too possessive . stengel inherited dimaggio , rizzuto , but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors , from joplin to new york . with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , ol' case wanted no. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . inheriting a more mature mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off broadway , ralph houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on mickey . the major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far . the opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in los angeles' wrigley field jr. , mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , babe ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . four for alvin mays' day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year . willie's wonderful walloping sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark . next to leo durocher , dark taught mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the giants win a dramatic pennant . romantic news concerns mrs. joan monroe armour and f. lee h. wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the

! the last obstacle in mrs. geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from egypt and the united arab republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa . first , honolulu honolulu will be mrs. geraghty's first stop . then japan , hong kong , manila , india , pakistan , damascus , beirut , and to rome , london , and paris `` to look over wonderful talent '' . dec. 22 is the deadline for mrs. geraghty's return ; ; the geraghtys' youngest daughter , molly , bows in the passavant debutante cotillion the next night . molly already has her cotillion gown , and it's fitted , says her mother . also , invitations have been addressed to molly's debut tea the afternoon of dec. 29 in the arts club . it won't be a `` tea '' , however , but more of an international folk song festival , with singers from chicago's foreign groups to sing christmas songs from around the world . the international theme will be continued with the balkan strings playing for a dinner the byron harveys will give in the racquet club after the tea . miss abra prentice's debut supper dance in the casino will wind up the day . burke-rostagno the richard s. burkes' home in wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter , helen lambert , and the young italian she met last year while studying in florence during her junior year at smith college . he is aldo rostagno , son of the guglielmo rostagnos of florence whom the burkes met last year in europe . the burkes , who now live in kankakee , are telling friends of the engagement . miss burke , a graduate of miss hall's school , stayed on in florence as a career girl . her fiance , who is with a publishing firm , translates many books from english into italian . he will be coming here on business in december , when the wedding is to take place in wayne . miss burke will arrive in december also . here and there a farewell supper mr. and mrs. charles h. sethness jr. planned sunday for italian consul general and mrs. giacomo profili has been canceled because mr. sethness is in illinois masonic hospital for surgery . mrs. william odell , mrs. clinton b. king , john holabird jr. , norman boothby , and actress maureen o'sullivan will judge the costumes in the grand march at the affaire old towne bal masque tomorrow in the germania club . the party is to raise money for the old town art center and to plant more crabapple trees along the streets of old town . lyon around : columnist walter winchell , well and rat-a-tat-tatty again , wheeled thru town between trains yesterday en route to his phoenix , ariz. , rancho , portable typewriter in hand . if w. w.'s retiring soon , as hinted , he ain't talking -- yet . pretty sunny ainsworth , the ex-mrs. tommy manville and the ex-mrs. bud arvey , joined playboy-show-biz illustrated , as a promotional copy writer . she's a whiz . you can get into an argument about fallout shelters at the drop of a beer stein in clubs and pubs these nights . everybody has a different idea on the ethics and morals of driving away neighbors , when and if . comic gary morton signed to play the living room here dec. 18 , because that's the only time his heart , lucille ball , can come along . and watch for a headline from this pair any time now . the living room has another scoop : jane russell will make one of her rare night club singing appearances there , opening jan. 22 . la russell's run in `` skylark '' , debuting next week at drury lane , already is a sellout . johnny ray , at the same l. r. , has something to cry about . he's been warbling in severe pain ; ; a medico's injection inflamed a nerve , and johnny can barely walk . charley simonelli , top universal-international film studio exec , makes an honest man out of this column . as we bulletin'd way back , he'll wed pretty rosemary strafaci , of the golf mag staff , in n. y. c. today . handsome bachelor charley was a favorite date of many of hollywood's glamor gals for years . george simon , exec director of danny thomas a. l. s. a. c.

kelsey of scarsdale , n.y. . mrs. kelsey is the former miss ann rickenbaugh . a cheery smile , a compassionate interest in others and a practical down-to-earth approach . those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation army's social center at 1200 larimer st. . the pert , gray-haired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo , n.y. , is a `` civilian '' with the army . her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . the job also covers a number of other items . `` mom '' marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during may , which is national salvation army week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , mrs. marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . mrs. marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . `` usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , mrs. marr explained . the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . `` and i bum tickets to everything i can '' , she said . `` i've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . in addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , mrs. marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . mrs. marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . by mid-june , millions of americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . in another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-american summer safari will be under way . by july 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` no vacancy '' . no matter how many americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . and where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? ah , that is simple . home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . that is where we turn in the good old summertime . the land lies ready for the coming onslaught . my husband and i , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson , ariz. , to new york city : set for influx i can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . there are motels for all purposes and all tastes . there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock , tex. , as i discovered . there the royal motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free tv , storm cellar '' . many with pools innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . all for $14 ! ! at the boxwood motel in winchester , va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . all for $14 . that made up for the `` best '' motel in norman , okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . oxnard , calif. , will be the home of the rev. robert d. howard and his bride , the former miss judith ellen

through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 a.m. next saturday . the current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . howard e. simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b. & o. operates . salary cut and lay-offs it will be accomplished in two ways : 1 a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . there are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 2 sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a b. & o. spokesman said . those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at franklin and mount streets . the victim , norman b. wiley , 38 , of the 900 block north charles street , was treated for cuts at franklin square hospital after the robbery . the driver told police he followed as the negro man got out of the cab with his money . the victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . he said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at pennsylvania avenue and gold street . in another attack , samuel verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block aiken street , told police two negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . a baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room anne arundel county home . the victim darnell somerville , negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at anne arundel general hospital in annapolis . his sister and brother , marie louise , 3 , and john raymond , jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . the girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body . boy in fair condition the boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . his condition was reported to be fair . police said the children's mother , mrs. eleanor somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . the house is on old annapolis road a mile south of severna park , at jones station , police said . annapolis , jan. 7 -- the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . the proposal was made by dr. david s. jenkins after he and mrs. d. ellwood williams , jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . the disagreement was over what dr. jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . cites discrepancies mrs. williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr. jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . `` i hate to have these things come up again and again '' , dr. jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . `` these are the board's minutes . i'll write what you tell me to '' . for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . it was about that time , a board member said later , that dr. thomas g. pullen , jr. , state superintendent of schools , told dr. jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . the board of county commissioners , the sanitary commission , the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . dr. jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the state do not do so . state senator joseph a. bertorelli ( d. , first baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street . he was taken to university hospital in a municipal ambulance . doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . his condition was said to be , `` fair '' . police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 west pratt street . barber summoned he called vincent l. piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . councilman william d. schaefer ( d. , fifth ) said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month . werner criticized conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm , mr. schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december . equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , mr. schaefer said . the councilman , who is the administration floor leader , also criticized bernard l. werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations '' on tuesday night after the sunday storm . sent home for rest mr. werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . what he did , mr. werner said , was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest . work resumed wednesday , he said . mr. schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced '' . admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' . recounting personal observations of clearance work , the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes . annapolis , jan. 7 ( special ) -- the 15-year-old adopted son of a washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their chesapeake bay-front home , has been sent to spring grove state hospital for detention . the victims were h. malone dresbach , 47 , and his wife , shirley , 46 . each had been shot in the back several times with a automatic rifle , according to capt. elmer hagner , chief of anne arundel detectives . judge benjamin michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the anne arundel county jail . the circuit court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in juvenile court . younger son calls police soon after 10 a.m. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the franklin manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the dresbach's other son , lee , 14 , they found mrs. dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . the younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car . the description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout southern maryland on police radio . two brothers adopted police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the dresbachs . trooper j. a. grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a route 2 service station , just outside annapolis . the driver admitted he was the dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the edgewater station , police said . annapolis , jan. 7 -- governor tawes today appointed lloyd l. simpkins , his administrative assistant , as maryland's secretary of state . mr. simpkins will move into the post being vacated by thomas b. finan , earlier named attorney general to succeed c. ferdinand sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the maryland court of appeals . governor tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next friday . simpkins from somerset mr. simpkins is a resident of somerset county , and he and the governor , also a somerset countian , have been friends since mr. simpkins was a child . now 38 , mr. simpkins was graduated from the university of maryland's college of agriculture in 1947 . five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law . mr. simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the house of delegates from 1951 through 1958 . from the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the house of delegates . maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to october , 1960 , f. w. dodge , dodge corporation , reported . dodge reported the following breakdown : nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; ; residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . the cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . a breakdown of the ten-month total showed : nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; ; residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . in 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , leo j. pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house . convenience held key `` convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 '' , pantas predicted . sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section . ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by johns-manville corporation . london , feb. 9 -- vital secrets of britain's first atomic submarine , the dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire united states navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a london-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year . it is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navy's nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack . five held for trial the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . a full trial was ordered for : two british civil servants , miss ethel gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , harry houghton , 55 , and divorced . they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . gordon a. lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport . when arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . flashed to moscow a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger , bookseller , and wife , joyce . ( in washington , the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen , an american couple formerly of new york city ) . in their suburban cottage the crown charges , the krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . all five pleaded innocent . only miss gee asked for bail . her young british lawyer , james dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . refuses to grant bail `` i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , k.j.p. baraclough . the trial will be held , probably the first week of march , in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs , the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . he promptly went to communist east germany . the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in american and british currency , mostly $20 bills , and in british government bonds and stocks . `` this is russian money '' , said mervin griffith-jones for the attorney general's office . he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow , lonsdale the red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . `` of highest value '' the fact that secrets of the dreadnought , and thereby of the american undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , capt. george symonds . he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon , jan. 7 . the information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . court cleared just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . the british defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet . britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed . the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack . with the machinery went a complete design for the hull . the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it . navy's future involved `` much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an american naval announcement said on the skipjack's first arrival in british waters in august , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station . it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . `` her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . the atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp. . thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . it was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the albacore , in 1954 . the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . it could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . it was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . interested in detector the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . range was a vital detail . designs of parts were sought . six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in lonsdale's apartment and the krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . the charge that the federal indictment of three chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before judge joseph sam perry in federal district court . the three -- miles j. cooperman , sheldon teller , and richard austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . in his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , bernard h. sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . ' had to know peddlers ' `` when they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . they , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . this , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . `` in the same five year period that the united states says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the lambert tree award and the mayor's medal '' . no comments by u.s. in opening , d. arthur connelly , assistant united states attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . cooperman and teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , otis sears , 45 , of 6934 indiana av. . among other acts , teller and austin are accused of paying $800 to sears . the first witness , moses winston mardis , 5835 michigan av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . but court adjourned after he testified he introduced james white and jeremiah hope pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced pullings to jessy maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted . buaford robinson , 23 , of 7026 stewart av. , a cta bus

tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . a havana radio broadcast identified the americans as howard anderson and august jack mcnair . the

soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . `` emory university's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman henry l. bowden stated . but an official statement adopted by the 33-man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes . the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . `` emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . an emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . emory is affiliated with the methodist church . some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation . urged in 1954 the student newspaper , the emory wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . `` from its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said friday , `` emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning . teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under christian influence , are paramount in the emory university policy . `` as a private institution , supported by generous individuals , emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education . `` there is not now , nor has there ever been in emory university's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , emory university could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . corporate existence `` on the other hand , emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia . `` when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education '' . a young man was killed and two others injured at midnight

negotiations . they indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate . downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the friday mail . however , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend . gather here the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday . several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair . student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago . charles a. black , coahr chairman , said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct. 31 but had failed to show up . he declined to name the three . friday's letters asked for a nov. 15 meeting . failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' . black said coahr `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '' a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that `` extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '' besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead . r. e. killingsworth

county may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told friday . it is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in ga category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . william smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that multnomah , as of aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , smythe said . no request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . board oks pact the commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , roy webster , of hood river , and dr. ennis keizer , of north bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . the contract with ray field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . acting administrator andrew f. juras said that because of field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . salary termed modest juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . he also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . `` do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ? asked mrs. grace o. peck , representative from multnomah county , of the commission chairman , joseph e. harvey jr. . `` my feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him . the continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' . harvey criticized mrs. peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , mrs. lee patterson , took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday . a publicity release from oregon physicians service , of which harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between f & a and the commission staff . `` i rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this . i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' . harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' . the wife of convicted bank robber lawrence g. huntley was arrested in phoenix , ariz.

directed verdict of acquittal . a mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . the arrest of mr. parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . the first incident occurred before the trial got under way when judge h. hobart grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . he asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . neither was seated on the jury . then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . the juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . the judge replaced the juror with an

programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , carl w. buchheister , president of the national audubon society , said today . `` it is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . `` but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming . there have even been serious errors in the u. s. forest service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . `` the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , buchheister told the delegates . in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including point reyes ; ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; ;

makeshift cockpit installed in a v-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber . the world war 2 , german bomber rolled down a runway and took off . the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . this had never been done before . now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheed's missiles and space division at sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the navy's polaris missile . he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . `` the first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . `` i had developed the machines and therefore knew them . it was time to go up myself '' . fiedler was then technical director of hitler's super-secret `` reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the allies until after the war . about 200 of the special v-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . the target was allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe . the success of the project depended upon fiedler's flight . squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . at 12,000 feet , fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the heinkel . to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . it was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . `` she flew beautifully '' , said fiedler . `` there was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . moments later the v-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles . the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into allied hands . now a family man with three children , fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale . his spare time is spent in soaring gliders . `` it's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' . john di massimo has been elected president of the 1961 columbus day celebration committee , it was announced yesterday . other officers are angelo

which begins tomorrow in sunnyvale . members of the san francisco american friends service , a quaker organization , will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 p.m. saturday . in a letter to the american friends service , dr. schweitzer wrote : `` leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . `` they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; otherwise no peace is possible . `` governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency '' . a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service . before he testified for 20 minutes , stein , who lives at 3300 lake shore dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . glimco a buddy among his gangland buddies , he said , were joseph ( joey ) glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , gus ( slim ) alex , ralph pierce , joe ( caesar ) divarco , and jimmy ( monk ) allegretti . another hoodlum , louis arger , drew $39,000 from stein's janitor firm , the national maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , stein disclosed in an interview . `` i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier '' , stein said . `` but arger never was able to produce it , so i cut him off my payroll '' . connection is sought other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including glimco and alex . the federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing stein's fees as a labor consultant . under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to stein's national maintenance company at 543 madison st. . the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . lee a witness among the witnesses were ed j. lee , director of mccormick place ; ; jerome leavitt , a partner in the union liquor company , 3247 s. kedzie av. , dominic senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of stein and a cousin of tony accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; and frank w. pesce , operator of a glimco dominated deodorant firm , the best sanitation and supply company , 1215 blue island av. . lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place . stein's fee , lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay . stein estimated this amount at `` about $1,500 or $1,600 a month '' . a $12,500 payment leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized leavitt's workers . leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' union . government attorneys , leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year . all of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by stein , according to leavitt . stein said he needed the money , leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll '' at national maintenance company . the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 blue island av. . the radiation station of the chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over chicago yesterday . the reading , which has been watched with interest since russia's detonation of a super bomb monday , was 4 on tuesday and 7 last saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . the weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . a board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . curtis allen huff , 41 , of 1630 lake av. , wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the first federal savings and loan association , 1 s. dearborn st. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000 . lien payments involved huff's attorney , antone f. gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' . huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . huff lives with his wife , sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage . charge lists 3 checks the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by leo blaber , an attorney for the association . the shortage was discovered after huff failed to report for work on sept. 18 . on that date , according to gregorio , huff left his home and took a room in the new lawrence hotel at 1020 lawrence av. . there , gregorio said , huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . later , huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the sherman house , using a credit card . all bounced . when huff attempted to cash another $100 check there monday , hotel officials called police . bonn , oct. 24 ( upi ) -- greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay $28,700,000 to greek victims of nazi persecution , it was announced today . probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . for many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . in fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . a measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . the first over-the-counter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler , guerin & turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around $22 a share . but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for morton foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering . `` we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas . cable confirmation '' , it said translated . but e.g.t. could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares . after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . but the result of it all was , e.g.t. partner dean guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . `` i feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do . but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . first , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . as a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- frito and h. w. lay -- on the market . both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast run-up . and third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . the potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . the history of the u.s. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito . all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . now , if morton's newest product , a corn chip known as chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars . more than 10 companies maintain facilities in dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at sherman . it is no coincidence that the texas cotton ginner's association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history . the exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the state fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars . it weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year . a modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the u.s. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area . the murray co. of texas , inc. , originated in dallas in 1896 . they've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's . more than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown . murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a dallas-based firm . the continental gin co. began operations in dallas in 1899 . the present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 . headquarters is in birmingham , ala. . factories are located here and in prattville , ala. . about 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the dallas plant by more than 200 employes . the company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world . hardwicke-etter co. of sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment . the firm recently expanded domestic sales into the southeastern states as a result of an agreement with cen-tennial gin co. . they export also . the company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies . in 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment . presently , hardwicke-etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year . the lummus cotton gin co. has had a sales and service office in dallas since 1912 . factory operations are in columbus , ga. . the district office here employs about 65 . the moss gordin lint cleaner co. and gordin unit system of ginning have joint headquarters here . the cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959 . gordin manufacturing operations are in lubbock . the john e. mitchell co. began work in dallas in 1928 . the firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment . the increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation . mitchell employs a total of about 400 people . they export cotton ginning machinery . the hinckley gin supply co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment '' . this includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin . the firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the mississippi delta . the cen-tennial gin supply co. has home offices and factory facilities here . they make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery . the stacy co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in texas . they've been in dallas since 1921 . cotton belt gin service , inc. of dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago . they distribute equipment in 11 states . the firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting , bearings , etc. . cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of dallas business economy . new car sales in dallas county during march showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year . registrations of new cars in dallas county cracked the 3,000 mark in march for the first time this year . totaling 3,399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over february's 2,963 . however , compared with march 1960 new car sales of 4,441 , this march was off 23 per cent . on a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744 . this year-to-year decline for dallas county closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the u.s. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier . with the march pickup , dealers are optimistic that the april-june quarter will equal or top last year . the march gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter . on the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars . only three standard models -- buick , chrysler , and mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in march sales in the county . the top 3 students from 11 participating dallas county high schools will be honored by the dallas sales executives club at a banquet at 6 p.m. tuesday in the sam houston room of the sheraton-dallas hotel as the club winds up its annual distributive education project . now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship . business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields . more than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis . principal address will be delivered by gerald t. owens , national sales manager for isodine pharmical corp. of new york . the 33 honored students are : mike trigg , raymond arrington , and ronald kaminsky of bryan adams , janice whitney , fil terral , and carl david page of w. h. adamson ; ; bill burke , tommie freeman , and lawrence

, and robert bailey of woodrow wilson . the kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the federal housing administration , came under fire in dallas last week . the administration's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated caron s. stallard , first vice-president of the mortgage bankers association of america . santa barbara -- `` the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , beryl w. sprinkel , economist of harris trust & savings bank , chicago , predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn. , california group , conference . another speaker , william h. draper , jr. , former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper , gaither & anderson , urged the u.s. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' . he urged support for president kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . ' not flash in pan ' sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . `` in view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . thesis refuted sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . danger cited he cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . the unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike . sacrifices needed draper declared , `` as i see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today . we must justify our heritage . we must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' . he said that from his experience of two years with gen. clay in west berlin administration , that `` russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' . he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' . while he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro , `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere . its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i don't believe we can permit that '' . new york ( ap ) -- stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of monday's losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks . analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average . it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages . some good news although it looked like a routine technical snapback to wall streeters it was accompanied by some good news . a substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month . treasury secretary douglas dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxes . the dow jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87 . of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined . new highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 . trading was comparatively dull throughout the day . volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million monday . a $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g. peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the american marketing assn. . however , peterson , president of bell & howell , warned 800 u.s. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' . creations needed `` as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , peterson said . `` with this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' . the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs . nothing to fear peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas . he cited , as an example , how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology . he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market . election of howard l. taylor to membership in pacific coast stock exchange , effective tuesday , has been announced by thomas p. phelan , president of the exchange . taylor , president and voting stockholder of taylor and co. , beverly hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925 . union oil co. of california tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by dillon , read & co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by gulf oil corp. . gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of union oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to union . under the new offering , only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares . due in 1986 the new offering tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures , due june 1 , 1986 , at 100% , and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due june 1 , 1991 , at 100% . the convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by june 1 , 1966 ; ; $70 by 1971 ; ; $75 by 1976 ; ; $80 by 1981 ; ; $85 by 1986 , and $90 thereafter . new york ( ap ) -- american stock exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled . volume was 1.23 million shares , down from monday's 1.58 million . gains of 2-3/4 were posted for teleprompter and republic foil . fairchild camera and kawecki chemical gained 2-1/2 each . question -- i bought 50 shares of diversified growth stock fund on oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on feb. 8 , 1960 . something has gone wrong some place . i am getting dividends on only 50 shares . in other words , i am getting only half the dividends i should . answer -- write to the fund's custodian bank -- the first national bank of jersey city , n.j. . that bank handles most of the paper work for diversified growth stock fund , fundamental investors , diversified investment fund and television-electronics fund . the bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things . but it seems that this `` electronic brain '' wasn't `` programmed '' correctly . this resulted in a great number of errors . and letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders . i visited the bank in march and wrote a story about the situation . at that time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand . they indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days '' . that 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts . maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected . any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank . doyle cannot undertake to reply to inquiries . he selects queries or general interest to answer . washington ( ap ) -- alfred hayes , president of the federal reserve bank of new york , said tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system . hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations , `` there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' . washington ( upi ) -- new york central railroad president alfred e. perlman said tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the chesapeake & ohio and baltimore & ohio railroads merge . perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect . the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round 2 of its hearing into the c & o's request to control and then merge with the b & aj . `` all these kind of things weaken us '' , perlman said . bad condition board chairman howard simpson of the baltimore & ohio railroad co. , testified the b & o was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the chesapeake & ohio railroad . `` the financial situation of the baltimore & ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s '' , he told the hearing . c & o president walter j. tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by new york central attorneys before examiner john bradford who is hearing the complex case . the new york central also has asked the icc to permit it to gain control of the b & aj . central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger . the proposed c & o-b & o railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest . washington ( ap ) -- the government's short-term borrowing costs rose with tuesday's weekly offering of treasury bills . on $1.1 billion of 90-day bills , the average yield was 2.325% . the rate a week ago was 2.295% . washington , march 11 ( upi ) . -- `` consumer uncertain about economic conditions '' . this was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center . other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . increase expected the poll was taken at the center's annual builders' intentions conference . it disclosed that the builders : expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts . the industry has said 1960 was a poor year . starts were down 20 percent from 1959 . why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? leaders of industry the reason , says the housing center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . elburn , ill. -- farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` we've sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more . we sold only four pickers all last year '' . gus ehlers , competitor of mr. houtz in this farm community , says his business since august 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . `` before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output . although the administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . the higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . `` in august our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says mark v. keeler , farm equipment vice president of international harvester co. . for the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; the drought-seared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . `` farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says jack martin , who sells j. i. case tractors and implements in sioux city , iowa . `` this morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . mr. martin sold 21 tractors in august ; ; in august of 1960 , he sold seven . dealers' stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . for example , farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5% above a year earlier , mr. keeler reports . tractor production at massey-ferguson , ltd. , of toronto in july and august rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says john staiger , vice president . with the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . merritt d. hill , ford motor co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . the rise in sales last winter was checked when the government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . the government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-september for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-july . kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling . the supreme court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . the company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . president kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . `` my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the president said . charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the i.r.s. . the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution . requests for substantiation , the service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show . in such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax , under federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . the corporation , in filing its final federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under u.s. tax law . the revenue service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . the tax court rejected this view . it said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a year-old i.r.s. ruling on the subject . the service has not said what its next step will be . peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . it provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the tax court ruled . the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . the court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances . hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage . she would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . in that event , they note , the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . possible upshots : the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . state briefs : voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area . colorado has a 2% sales tax . denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax . the washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent . the state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales . the court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities . washington -- consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months , the government reported . the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in april , down 1% from the march level of more than $18.2 billion . april sales also were 5% below those of april last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on page one ) . the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-easter buying was pushed into march . commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march . adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of $17.8 billion . greer garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . as a neiman-marcus award winner the titian-haired miss garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . she will receive the 1961 `` oscar '' at the 24th annual neiman-marcus exposition , tuesday and wednesday in the grand ballroom of the sheraton-dallas hotel . the only woman recipient , miss garson will receive the award with ferdinando sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; harry rolnick , president of the byer-rolnick hat corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; sydney wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and roger vivier , designer of christian dior shoes paris , france , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . the silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by stanley marcus , president of neiman-marcus , beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the dallas society for crippled children cerebral palsy treatment center . the attractive greer garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` it's unlike me '' . in private life , miss garson is mrs. e. e. fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their california home in los angeles' suburban bel-air to their ranch in pecos , new mexico . therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . a favorite is norman norell , however . she likes his classic chemise . her favorite cocktail dress is a norell , a black and white organdy and silk jersey . irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette . she also likes the femininity and charm of designs by ceil chapman and helen rose . balenciaga is her favorite european designer . `` i bought my first dress from him when i was still a struggling young actress '' , she reminisces . `` i like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion '' . black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens . of scotch-irish-scandinavian descent , greer garson was born in county down , ireland . her mother was a greer and her father's family came from the orkney isles . reared in england , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the university of london . she took postgraduate work at the university of grenoble in france and then returned to london to work on market research with an advertising firm . her acting began with the birmingham repertory company and she soon became the toast of the west end . among stage performances was a starring role in `` golden arrow '' directed by noel coward . it was during `` old music '' at the st. james theater that hollywood's louis b. mayer spotted her . after signing a motion-picture contract , she came to america and had `` goodbye , mr. chips '' as her first assignment after a year's wait . other triumphs include `` random harvest '' , `` madame curie '' , `` pride and prejudice '' , `` the forsythe saga '' and `` mrs. miniver '' ( which won her the academy award in 1943 ) . honors that have come to greer garson are countless . just this april she was nominated for the seventh time for an academy award for her portrayal of eleanor roosevelt in `` sunrise at campobello '' . she gave a fine portrayal of auntie mame on broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` captain brassbound's conversion '' to `` camille '' . she is in madame tussard's waxworks in london , a princess of the kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states . she is adept at skeet shooting , trout fishing , afro-cuban and oriental dancing and southwestern archaeology . she now serves on the board of directors of the dallas symphony orchestra and the dallas theater center and on the board of trustees of the dallas museum of fine arts . she is state chairman for the new mexico tuberculosis and cancer associations . both miss garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of boys clubs of america and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in new mexico . back in college , today's handsome gander was the only male member of a texas tech class on food . the pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy . last october he gave a public speech in washington , d.c. entitled `` are women here to stay '' ? ? so you can see that gerald g. ramsey , director of smu's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef . he is apt to rear back and claim his rights . ramsey , as smu's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week . tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! ! he also dishes up 3,000 snacks . and he operates three cafeterias in the student center , along with mcelvaney dining hall and the athlete's tables . ramsey , 6-3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says , `` i can't remember when i didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook '' . he was in charge of the hockaday school meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to aj . and you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line . what does he feed his smu football mastodons at the training table ? ? `` mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat '' , says ramsey . so he hides the mayonnaise . and to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments . what do the pretty smu girls like on their plates ? ? `` pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza '' , says the handsome food expert . `` unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' . ramsey has stoked up harry truman , henry cabot lodge , the king of morocco , clement atlee and other shiny characters . once four tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line . `` they aren't supposed to look at women , you know '' , ramsey recalled . `` what with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard time '' . chicken cadillac use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest . salt and pepper each breast . dip in melted butter and roll in flour . place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan . bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 f. until lightly brown . add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts . bake slowly at least one-half hour longer . while this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter . sprinkle over top of chicken breasts . serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with thompson seedless grapes . ( leave off the ham and you call it chicken pontiac , says ramsey . ) contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month . though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . these two , heritage and drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . the heritage collection , to be shown by sanger-harris and anderson's studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . called perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . it is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . the drexel collection , called composite , to be shown by titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia . a high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . the other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . colorful , bright eastman chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite . the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexel's fall 1961 group , composite . the spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . see-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor . to bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the perennian collection from heritage . center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile . the vagabonds are `` on the road '' again . members are on their way to saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars . this coming weekend they have reserved the entire stagecoach inn and adjoining country club , saledo , for festivities . invitations have been extended to some austin dignitaries including gov. and mrs. price daniel . stagecoach days is the theme for the weekend on the old chisholm trail . the get-together friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing . guests will wear costumes typical of the chisholm trail days . ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women . the men will be in western attire , including stetsons and colored vests . decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of texas , in tall bushes ; ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes . there will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests . mr. and mrs. phil g. abell are chairmen for the saledo trip . committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are messrs and mmes roy mckee , george mcelyee , jack fanning , w. h. roquemore and joe darrow . the travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto `` go somewhere , anywhere , everywhere '' . their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to europe . in the past , the men and women have chartered planes to las vegas and jamaica , buses to mineral wells and kerrville and private railway coaches to shreveport and galveston . four parties are given a year . two of these are in or near dallas and the others away from the vicinity . serving on the club's board are mmes r. p. anderson , president ; ; a. f. schmalzried , secretary ; ; w. h. roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : mmes mckee , publicity ; ; lawrence b. jones , yearbook , and sam laughlin , scrapbook . a cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual pillsbury bake-off tuesday . mrs. alice h. reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the beverly hilton hotel . mrs. reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . second grand prize of $5,000 went to mrs. clara l. oliver for her hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . mother of five mrs. oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . she lives in wellsville , mo. . mrs. reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the bake-off finals . and the third time was the charm . she dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . the second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist . the third time was on the floor of the beverly hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges . mr. and mrs. joseph r. bolker will give a dinner on friday at their home in beverly hills to honor mrs. norman chandler , chairman of the music center building fund committee , and mr. chandler . mr. bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts . a feature of the party will be a presentation by welton becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex . foliage will glow at formal fall party fall foliage and flowers will decorate los angeles country club for the annual formal party saturday evening . more than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring . among those with reservations are messrs. and mmes. william a. thompson , van cott niven , a. b. cox , david bricker , samuel perry and robert d. stetson . others are drs. and mmes. alfred robbins , and j. lafe ludwig and gen. and mrs. leroy watson . guests from across u.s. honor dr. swim when dr. w. a. swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the wilshire country club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country . a flight originating in florida picked up guests on the east coast and midwest and a plane left from seattle taking on passengers at west coast points . cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known dr. swim when he practiced in los angeles . he started practice in 1917 , and served on the state board of medical examiners . giving up the violin opened a whole new career for ilona schmidl-seeberg , a tiny hungarian who fritz kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing . she put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in budapest . now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles . her days as an art student at the university of budapest came to a sudden end during the hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna . there they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . and there she had her first showing of tapestry work . there's a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today . what most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as i am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . getting to and from school was no problem . they either walked or were driven . now they go to a high school that is two miles away . one might think the problem would be similar . they could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . it's much more complex than that . generally , they go to school with a girl named gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . this is a way of getting to school , but , i understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . a young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . `` why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? i suggested . `` my father walked , through two miles of snow , in illinois '' . `` did you '' ? ? i was asked . `` no '' , i said , `` i didn't happen to grow up in illinois '' . i explained , however , that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . i had to ride a streetcar two miles . sometimes the streetcar was late . sometimes there weren't even any seats . i had to stand up , with the ladies . sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . i've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . she has to have at least one car herself . i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . even that isn't satisfactory . if they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . they say that when they take a car , gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . the logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself . the solution , naturally , is the bus . however , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . but that's hardly realistic . nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman , and he's already got an education . advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the new york social register which made news last week . published annually by william hord richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled society register of southern california , is scheduled to arrive with monday morning's postman . publisher richardson has updated the blue book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . stars for marriage stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year . last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper , daughter of the grant b. coopers , to robert knox worrell , and of mary alice ghormley to willard pen tudor . others are carla ruth craig to dan mcfarland chandler jr. ; ; joanne curry , daughter of the ellsworth currys , to james hartley gregg , and valerie smith to james mcalister duque . also noted are the marriages of elizabeth browning , daughter of the george l. brownings , to austin c. smith jr. ; ; cynthia flower , daughter of the ludlow flowers jr. , to todd huntington , son of the david huntingtons . pasadena listings listed as newly wed in the pasadena section of the new book are mr. and mrs. samuel moody haskins 3 . she is the former judy chapman , daughter of john s. chapman of this city . the young couple live in pasadena . another marriage of note is that of jane mcalester and william louis pfau . changes in address are noted . for instance , the edwin pauleys jr. , formerly of chantilly rd. , are now at home on north arden dr. in beverly hills . mr. and mrs. robert moulton now live on wilshire and the franklin moultons on s. windsor blvd. . the richard beesemyers , formerly of connecticut , have returned to southern california and are now residing on south arden blvd. . but the raoul esnards have exchanged their residence in southern california for mexico city . more new addresses judge and mrs. julian hazard are now at laguna beach , while the frank wangemans have moved from beverly hills to new york , where he is general manager of the waldorf-astoria hotel . and lawrence chase , son of the ransom chases , is listed at his new address in oxford , eng. . others listed at new addresses are the richard t. olerichs , the joseph aderholds jr. , the henri de la chapelles , the john berteros and dr. and mrs. egerton crispin , the john armisteads , the allen chases , the howard lockies , the thomas lockies , and anthony longinotti . newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the ray carbones , formerly of panama ; ; the geddes macgregors , formerly of scotland , and mr. and mrs. werner h. althaus , formerly of switzerland . here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . to create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` l '' , the foot of the `` l '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . in this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . if the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . the scalloped edge is particularly appealing . today's trend toward furniture designs from america's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era . a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . in the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . so junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . this isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , leland alden . housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says mr. alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . solid investment there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . hotel escape's bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` kings 4 , plus two '' . this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . show spotlights the kings -- george worth , bill kay , frank ciciulla and gene wilson , flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens . the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . in the comedy division , the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs . if they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , elsewhere andy bartha and his trio have booked into oceania lounge . the cumbancheros , latin combo , open tuesday at the four o'clock club . `` flip '' phillips for a return engagement at fireside steak ranch wednesday ; ; same date , johnny lasalle trio to the jolly roger . dick carroll and his accordion ( which we now refer to as `` freida '' ) held over at bahia cabana where `` sir '' judson smith brings in his calypso capers oct. 13 . johnny leighton picked up some new numbers out in texas which he's springing on the ringsiders in the rum house at galt ocean mile hotel . `` skip '' hovarter back in town from a summer in the reno-lake tahoe area where he ran into rusty warren , kay martin , the marskmen and tune toppers -- all pulling good biz , he says . we like fike al fike , an ex-schoolteacher from colorado , is currently pursuing the three r's -- rhythm , reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the trade winds hotel . al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring . newcomers are ernie kemm on piano , wes robbins , bass and trumpet , and jack kelly on drums . it's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by ernie , it's al's all the way . maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . he skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act . this is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal . new owners cafe society opens formally this afternoon under its new ownership . george kissak is the bossman ; ; terry barnes has been named manager . spot retains the same decor although crystal chandeliers have been installed above the terrace dining area , and the kitchen has undergone a remodeling job . latter domain , under the guidance of chef tom yokel , will specialize in steaks , chops , chicken and prime beef as well as tom's favorite dish , stuffed shrimp . bandstand features hal decicco , pianist , for both dinner hour and the late trade . the tic-tac-toe trio is the club's new show group which also plays for dancing . here and there herbert heilman in town for a day . hubie's restaurant activities up in lorain , ohio , may preclude his return here until after oct. 20 ,

has such a run on beer to wash down that mexican food `` tex '' burgess had to call the draft man twice in one day . ( which is understandable -- if you've ever sampled the exotic , peppery fare . ) faces in places pualani and randy avon , dave searles , george ( papa ) gill , al bandish , jim morgart , bob neil at the mouse trap . billy and jean moffett at the rickshaw . bea morley , jimmy fazio , jim o'hare , ralph michaels , bill and evelyn perry at the escape . murphy honors hear that patricia murphy flies up to st. john's newfoundland , next sunday to attend the government's special ceremonies at memorial university honoring distinguished sons and daughters of the island province . miss murphy was born in placentia , newfoundland . her invitation from premier joseph smallwood is reported to be the only one extended to a woman . fort lauderdale -- the first in a series of five productions will be held in war memorial auditorium thursday , oct. 26 . `` le theatre d'art du ballet '' , of monte carlo , will present a program of four ballets including `` francesca da rimini '' . performers include a company of 46 dancers and a symphony orchestra . the series of ballets is sponsored by the milenoff ballet foundation , inc. , a non-profit foundation with headquarters in coral gables . also set for appearances at the auditorium this season are : `` american ballet theatre '' on jan. 27 , `` ximenez-vargas ballet espagnol '' on feb. 2 ;

; a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami ; ; and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days , by ted place , director of greater miami youth for christ , and jon braun , director of campus crusade for christ . the second half of the film `` communism on the map '' and the movie `` operation abolition '' also will be shown . response to the program has been so encouraging , kern said , that a city-wide youth school at dade county auditorium may be set up soon . and to encourage other churches to try their own programs , kern said this sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations . the need for and the way to achieve a christian home will be stressed in special services marking national christian family week in miami area churches next week . of particular meaning to the charles macwhorter family , 3181 sw 24th ter. , will be the family dedication service planned for 10:50 a.m. sunday at first christian church . it will be the second time the assistant manager of a coral gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies . the first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life . `` when you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows '' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples sunday school class . until that first dedication service , he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home . they have five daughters -- coral lee , 5 , glenda rae , 4 , pamela , 3 , karen , 2 , and shari , five months . but after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and bible stories . to their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part . even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her . dade's chief probation officer , jack blanton , will lead a discussion on `` the changes in the american family '' at 7:30 p.m. sunday at christ lutheran church . mr. and mrs. george treadwell will be honored at a family week supper and program at 6 p.m. sunday at trinity methodist church . he is the sexton of the church . a family worship service will follow the program at 7:45 p.m. . the outstanding family of central nazarene church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10:45 a.m. sunday service marking national family week . every family of riviera presbyterian church has been asked to read the bible and pray together daily during national christian family week and to undertake one project in which all members of the family participate . to start the week of special programs at the church , the rev. john d. henderson will preach on `` a successful marriage '' at 9:40 and 11 a.m. sunday . new officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service . a father and son dinner sponsored by the men's club will be held at 6:15 p.m. monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next saturday . the week will end with the rev. mr. henderson preaching on `` the marriage altar '' at 7:30 p.m. sunday , may 14 . the resignation of the rev. warren i. densmore , headmaster of st. stephen's episcopal day school in coconut grove , becomes effective july 15 . enrique jorda , conductor and musical director of the san francisco symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in europe before returning home to open the symphony's golden anniversary season , it was announced . the guest assignments are scheduled for november 14 and 18 , with the orchestra sinfonica siciliana in palermo and the orchestra of radio cologne . the season in san francisco will open with a special gala concert on november 22 . during his five-month visit abroad , jorda recently conducted the orchestre philharmonique de bordeau in france , and the santa cecilia orchestra in rome . in announcing jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the sherman clay box office on wednesday . guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists yehudi menuhin , isaac stern , ruggiero ricci and david abel ; ; pianists leon fleisher , ruth slenczynka and stephen bishop and conductor earl bernard murray . the leningrad kirov ballet , which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house , is , i think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company i have ever seen , and the production of the petipa-tschaikowsky `` sleeping beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . this work is no favorite of mine . i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people ; ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirov's utterly captivating presentation . precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . in other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- miss omsk , miss pinsk , miss stalingr oops , skip it . these qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet . oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the kirov . this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics . but , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned . irina kolpakova , the princess aurora of friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . hit alla sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the east , was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner , yuri soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky . vladilen semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; konstantin shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; and inna zubkovskaya , an excellent lilac fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . the production , designed by simon virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . it was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , guy lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society . the season will open at the new hall of flowers in golden gate park on november 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the mills chamber players . sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; annual members may attend for $16 . participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in the chronicle ) . mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 chestnut street , san francisco 9 . san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children . fire fighters local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for san franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen . toys will not be collected at firehouses this year . they will be accepted at all branches of the bay view federal savings and loan association , at a collection center in the center of the stonestown mall , and at the junior museum , 16th street and roosevelt way . from the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution . any needy family living in san francisco can obtain toys by writing to christmas toys , 676 howard street , san francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 . requests must be mailed in by december 5 . famed cellist pablo casals took his instrument to the east room of the white house yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . he was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for puerto rico governor luis munoz marin . president kennedy's invitation to the spanish-born master said , `` we feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . for a good many seasons i've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . after all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . so i went to see `` la dolce vita '' . it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . if that's all the romans did , it's a surprise to me that rome fell . after television , `` la dolce vita '' seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night . i cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week . i believe tv watchers will be bored . `` la dolce vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western . week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` the adventures of ozzie and harriet '' . there is more decadence on `` 77 sunset strip '' . there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . in another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the robert herridge theater . most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! the dolce vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word i can think of : dull . apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall . what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! as a moral shocker it is a dud . but this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film . the chronicle's paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly : `` this is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . and when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing . tonight atlantic monthly editor edward weeks moderates a round table of four russian writers in a discussion of soviet literature . among the subjects discussed will be russian restrictions on poets and writers in the ussr ( channel 9 at 9:30 ) . person to person ventilates the home lives of johnny mercer and joan collins -- both in southern california ( channel 5 at 10:30 ) kqed summer music festival features a live concert by the capello de musica ( channel 9 at 8:30 ) . nbc plans a new series of three long programs exploring america's scientific plans titled `` threshold '' , to start in the fall . `` science in action '' , san francisco's venerable television program , will be seen in hong kong this fall in four languages : mandarin , cantonese , chiuchow and english , according to a tip from dr. robert c. miller . and you think you have language problems . the week went along briskly enough . i bought a new little foreign bomb . it is a british bomb . very austere yet racy . it is very chic to drive foreign cars . with a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back . you must also wear a car coat . the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive . but we couldn't really get along without it . `` where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha '' ? ? asked the gas station man . the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor . gas station people are very debonair about small cars . when i drove a car with tail fins , i had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases . my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth . this excellent foreign bomb takes only six . when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me . `` tires ok ? ? check the oil and water , sir ? ? '' they polished the windshield . they had a loving touch . the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank . `` what kind of car is it '' ? ? he asked gloomily . `` it is a british austin , the smallest they make '' . `` get much mileage '' ? ? `` about 35 '' . the gas station man sighed unhappily . `` what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? crunch , that's all she wrote '' . `` i will die rich '' . `` that will be $1.80 '' , said the gas station man . `` the windshield looks pretty clean '' . ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! ! when i wheeled about , finned fore and aft , i was the darling of the doormen . dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely . with a small bomb , i tuck it between cadillacs . ( the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself . high blood pressure can get the best of any of us . ) at last the white house is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master american craftsman , duncan phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u. s. presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings . the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansion's library . the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . the gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey , whose famous estate , `` tranquility '' , was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover , n. j. . authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . this acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedy's fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . it is the aid's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture . the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem , mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792 . the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace . it will be painted to match the paneling in the room . the aid committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , mrs. henry francis lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project . mrs. lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york , include mrs. allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j. jussel , both wellknown manhattan decorators . regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e. barnes of boston . president kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85-piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard , n. c. . but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . at 4 p.m. the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert . it was the first in the series of `` concerts for young people by young people '' to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house . she was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port , mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the president said he was representing her . as he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion , the band struck up the `` star spangled banner '' and followed it with `` hail to the chief '' . `` i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band , and we are grateful to them '' , president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl . after paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , president kennedy said , `` as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . he added `` i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . displaying his knowledge of music , the new england-born president remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont , by young americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the united states . `` this is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as i do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the white house '' . as he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . he expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde patricia holbrook , 16 , of mount rainier , had attended the joseph p. kennedy school for the handicapped in boston . `` the nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the president commented . patricia now attends the c. melvin sharpe health school in the district . each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff . many of the music-loving members of the president's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . henry hall wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the president's staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives , turned guest conductor for a sousa march , the `` stars and stripes forever '' . transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs. kennedy's social secretary , letitia baldrige , told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring . he said he contacted a friend , henry hall wilson , on the president's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student north carolina group to play the first concert . one of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house , was letitia baldrige , social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy . `` i was an art major in college '' , miss baldrige explained . `` i've been here so many times i couldn't count them '' . she turned out to be a fan , too , of margaret bouton , the gallery's associate curator of education . miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . they decided that they thought rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphael's `` alba madonna '' and `` texture '' in a monet painting of rheims cathedral . everybody had heard of van gogh , the french impressionist . gallery director john walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , richard bales . i'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' the confederacy ' '' . along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the gallery's blue-uniformed guards . in 45 minutes , the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century . a few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were boucher , courbet , fra angelico . the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . that imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , albert pike , who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891 . they came together in the huge , high-ceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . c. wheeler barnes of denver , head of the scottish rite in colorado , praised pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order . the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple . a reception and tea followed . about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states . the opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . there will be a pilgrimage to mount vernon at 2:30 p.m. . a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington , one of this nation's first masons -- a past master of washington-alexandria lodge 22 in alexandria . the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . hurt by his lack of interest and attention , mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . she accused him of ignoring her . he in turn told her she demanded too much . they were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . mary decided she had had enough . without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer . family service , sharing in ugf , has five agencies in the washington area . they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , mr. and mrs. black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia , the agency nearest them . for nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . they are now working together toward solving their difficulties . john received a promotion in his firm . he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . to outsiders , the blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . they know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . family service has helped hundreds of families in this area . perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . but to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . family service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund . anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . for crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev . mr. kennedy replied : `` i'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . the president knew that a confrontation with mr. khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . but he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u. s. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . last friday the white house announced : president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s. khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 . the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relations . the heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the president's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader . he was not going to vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . but mr. kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr. khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting . despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . road to vienna the u. s. and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . the first time was in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of geneva '' . the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east . in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u. s. . that meeting produced the `` spirit of camp david '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement . on the third occasion -- another big four summit session at paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u. s. for the u-2 incident . the episode tended to confirm the u. s. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the soviet leader's real aims in summitry . pre-inaugural position thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president , mr. kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words : `` as long as mr. khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . the president had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the u. s. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . he wanted time , too , to review the united states' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchev's doorstep . attitude flexible at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader . ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . but mr. kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe mr. khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u. s. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e. thompson brought back to russia late in february . the letter , dated feb. 22 , was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk , siberia , on march 9 . it dealt mainly with a broad range of east-west issues . but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr. khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . developments over the next two months , however , caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing . there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . deadlock on tests the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva . the deadlock has been caused by the russians' new demand for a three-man ( east , west and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . in the u. s. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing . mr. kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to communist china . the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent . moreover , moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the u. n. secretariat and the international control commission for laos . mr. kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . at the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west's ability and determination to resist communist pressure . in cuba , the u. s. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep . in laos , the picture was almost equally bad . u. s. willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on soviet terms . beyond that , allied disagreement about military intervention in laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-communist forces . as a result , the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos , and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure . in the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself . ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out . the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin , iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back . it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u. s. embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future . mr. kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies . the response from london , paris and bonn was favorable . firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week . apparently at the insistence of the u. s. , the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . the washington announcement said : `` the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . the meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . the outlook the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in mr. kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old president ( his birthday is may 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u. s. of both approval and disapproval . the approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at vienna . the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . mr. khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr. kennedy would give him pause . apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the u.s. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . this time the initiative came , in part at least , from washington . other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr. khrushchev , the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders . thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity . finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the president's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . if tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the u. s. make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union . disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . after cuba and laos , it was argued , mr. khrushchev will interpret the president's consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . moreover , the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of america's firm foreign policy commitments . the question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the president would take if mr. khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east . there are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . mollusks are a case in point . the shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education . there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . there is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . american catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . all of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . to understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of american catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . american catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . this `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . i think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university , which is also co-educational . this is not an isolated example ; ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . at the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . but with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . the problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . commenting on the earlier stage , the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` even with the best of intentions he ( the president of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . but in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . `` outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university . in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . to appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service . much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions . adequate compensation is indispensable . yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . the first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . in the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . in the notre dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . sen. john l. mcclellan of arkansas and rep. david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . or , in the words of anatole france , `` the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr. mcclellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . in addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill . it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . business week ( aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the united aircraft company , against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . the company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . the company has billed the united states government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . rep. frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee . the committee remains unresponsive . neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter ; ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . the anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; it must play a game in which there never is a winner . the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric , westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . the industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . naturally , enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . but if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . in other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday , wednesday and friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday , thursday and saturday . and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday ? ? the question might be asked : `` don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? the past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold , in the folklore of capitalism , back in 1937 . he wrote : `` ( p. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . ( p. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . ( p. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . in this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . ( pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . this escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . a plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . ( the penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . ) if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . however , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english . the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . the wagner act , the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . if a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . the problem must be faced squarely . if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century america . as early as 1776 , adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations : `` we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; but many against combining to raise it '' . eighteenth-century england , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . in 1825 , the boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . the courts shared the opinion of the employers . in people vs. fisher , justice savage of the new york supreme court declared : `` without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin , according to the daily labor report of sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . senator mcclellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . his bill , allegedly aimed at hoffa , would amend the sherman , clayton and norris-laguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . paradoxically , the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . indeed , it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies . it was most effective against trade unions . in the famous danbury hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . in 1914 , the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . the law could not suspend economics . labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . the courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . in 1922 , the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company . the company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . ( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? ) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . the nation the three-front war at a closed-door session on capitol hill last week , secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on u.s. affairs abroad . afterward , tennessee's democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen . what herter presented , said gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts . while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos , two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 1 ) cuba . hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery , dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the u.s. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the u.s. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 u.s. citizens , plus 120 cuban employees ) . president eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . `` there is a limit to what the united states in self-respect can endure '' , said the president . `` that limit has now been reached '' . through secretary herter , ike offered president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision . kennedy , through secretary-designate of state dean rusk , declined . he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the u.s. and latin america ( see the hemisphere ) . 2 ) laos . after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants , the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam . `` in view of the present situation in laos '' , said the pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific '' . cutting short a holiday at hong kong , the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . on the u.s.'s island base of okinawa , task force 116 , made up of army , navy , marine and air force units , got braced to move southward on signal . but by week's end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the u.s. was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-western -- government might be best for laos . french & indians . there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . `` it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again '' , said one military man . but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground ? ? at geneva in 1954 , to get the war in indo-china settled , the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state , north viet nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos . the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west . he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj . `` the important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia '' . russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana , russian intrigue in the congo , and russian arms drops in laos ( using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . soviet premier khrushchev sent new year's hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; but , in senator gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront john f. kennedy on inauguration day . the congress turmoil in the house as the 87th congress began its sessions last week , liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . the liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . this time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . they had the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck . and counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . deadly deadlock . there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely mississippi's 14-term william meyers colmer ( pronounced calmer ) . caucusing , the liberals decided to go after colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the house is next to godliness . a dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents . he is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-negro '' speech . for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee . there his vote , along with those of chairman howard smith , the courtly virginia judge , and the four republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . equal treatment . there was sufficient pretext to demand colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy electors in mississippi . reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons . in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman , and in 1957 , after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . ( in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week , judge smith threatened reprisal against powell . said he : `` we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here '' . ) but speaker sam rayburn , after huddling in palm beach with president-elect kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . in a tense , closed-door session with judge smith , rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the rules committee ( two democrats , including one southerner , and one republican ) . smith flatly rejected the offer , and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . news of rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . when missouri's clarence cannon got the word , he turned purple . `` unconscionable '' ! ! he shouted , and rushed off to the speaker's room to object : `` a dangerous precedent '' ! ! cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the smith-colmer forces : as chairman of the appropriations committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally , georgia's carl vinson , chairman of the armed services committee . threat of war . as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that judge smith could lose . his highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus . the liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the democratic committee on committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the house -- before they could oust colmer . ( one big question : if colmer was to be purged , what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? ) in all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash . but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . if the southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . with that possibility in mind , arkansas' wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees , and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . `` here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a house democratic leader . `` one wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . battle in the senate the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the house's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guide's speech . question at issue : how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? a wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from minnesota's democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts' republican leverett saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . new mexico's clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senate's notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . fair dealer humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators . georgia's dick russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . privately , the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . privately , they also admitted that their hopes for clint anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon . in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress , and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding . armed with the nixon opinion , the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . hopefully , the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . republicans last act since election day , vice president richard nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . but with the convening of the new congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the senate until john kennedy's inauguration . one day last week , nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . `` this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . gary player , the small , trim south african , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . arnold palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . `` just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . and that is just what happened on the last few holes . the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer . player was the first to feel its teeth . after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , player's game rapidly fell to pieces . he bogeyed the 10th . after a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , player was almost in tears . he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . palmer had started the round four strokes behind player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . but the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower . afterwards , palmer told charlie coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . he did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out , giving palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt . palmer's 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with coe . the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . end at seven until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69 . his three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by bill collins , the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . but palmer knew , as did everybody else at augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . half an hour after he finished his round , player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of palmer . more than a streak had ended . long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player . unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmer's towering prestige . as if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . player won only one . but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago , player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . on the final round at pensacola , the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer . he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmer's 71 . thereafter , until the masters , player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami . when they reached augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . instant rivalry on thursday , the first day of the masters , the contest between palmer and player developed instantly . it was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course . the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with bob rosburg . but player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between palmer and player . a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; or ken venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; or rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augusta's treacheries ; ; or even old byron nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . ( on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe . ) on friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time palmer and player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . he birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle , palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . the roar of palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of player's gallery for a similar triumph . at one point late in the day , when palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole . without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . the boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . the bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . bob jones played that way . byron nelson did , hogan did . and last week at the masters palmer and player did . as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . this day palmer had started first . as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . player immediately proceeded to follow suit . in fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . but player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . he hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . the latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . `` i was hitting the ball well '' , player said later , `` and i felt strong . when you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . they started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . on this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . starting the second nine , palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it . when mickey charles mantle , the new york yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . when roger eugene maris , mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . but when tiny , 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . this is baseball 1961 . this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . it is the year when ( 1 ) amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; ( 2 ) willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; ( 3 ) the milwaukee braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; and ( 4 ) catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion . whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . this , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , george herman ( babe ) ruth of the yankees . since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruth's amazing september surge . in the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . double threat : always , in the abortive attacks upon ruth's record , one man alone -- a jimmy foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a hank greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a hack wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . but now , for the first time since lou gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . their names are mantle and maris , their team is the yankees , and their threat is real . after 108 games in 1927 , ruth had 35 home runs . after 108 games in 1961 , mickey mantle has 43 , roger maris 41 . extend mantle's and maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them . to better ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular september flourish . all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september , and he will establish a new record . in ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . ) `` even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists hank greenberg , now vice-president of the chicago white sox . `` it has to be easier with two of them . how can you walk maris to get to mantle '' ? ? roommates : neither mantle nor maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` the important thing is to win the pennant '' . but one thing is for certain : there is no dissension between mantle , the american league's most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 , and maris , the mvp in 1960 . each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` i hope roger hits 80 '' , mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and i hope i hit 81 '' ) . the sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( mantle's in dallas , maris's in kansas city ) , they are rooming together . mantle , maris , and bob cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in jamaica , long island , not far from new york international airport . the three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . they divide up the household chores : cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible ) , and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium . mantle , maris , and cerv probably share one major-league record already : among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for cerv , four for mantle , and three for maris . as roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , mantle , 29 , who broke in with the yankees ten years ago , and maris , 26 , who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( mantle in commerce , okla. , maris in fargo , n.d. ) ; ; as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma ( `` sometimes in the minors '' , maris recalls , `` i wished i had gone to oklahoma '' ) . to an extent , the two even look alike . both have blue eyes and short blond hair . both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . maris purchases $100 suits from simpson's in new york . mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pays as much as $250 each . light reading : neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , henry miller's `` tropic of cancer '' . mantle so appreciated miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . `` what do you and mickey talk about at home '' ? ? a reporter asked maris recently . `` to tell you the truth '' , maris said , `` mickey don't talk much '' . this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . of the two , mantle is by nature the less outgoing , maris the more outspoken . but last week , when a reporter was standing near mantle's locker , mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . `` see that kid '' ? ? he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . `` that's ( yogi ) berra's . i'll never forget one time i struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . i came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' you stunk ' '' . maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . `` when i've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` i don't want to talk to anyone . i'm angry '' . by his own confession , maris is an angry young man . benched at tulsa in 1955 , he told manager dutch meyer : `` i can't play for you . send me where i can play '' . ( meyer sent him to reading , pa. . ) benched at indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager kerby farrell : `` i'm not learning anything on the bench . play me '' . ( farrell did -- and maris led the team to victory in the little world series . ) `` that's the way i am '' , he says . `` i tell people what i think . if you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . give me a team of nine angry men and i'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . idols' idols : one good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . maris's was ted williams . `` when i was a kid '' , maris told a sportswriter last week , `` i used to follow williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . `` when you came up to the majors , did you seek out williams for advice '' ? ? `` are you kidding '' ? ? said maris . `` you're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . mantle's hero was joe dimaggio . `` when mickey went to the yankees '' , says mark freeman , an ex-yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver , `` dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . but dimaggio never said a word . it crushed mickey . he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' . mantle has kept the vow . among all the yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . if laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the yankees , maris would lay ties on a railroad track . if working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the yankees , mantle would work in a zinc mine . but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , mantle and maris concentrate on baseball . they try to play baseball the best they can . each is a complete ballplayer . mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . ( `` one of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize mantle is head-and-shoulders above maris '' . ) hitting , mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , maris only left-handed . they both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( , fourth in the league , to for maris so far this year ) . both are good bunters : maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base . both have brilliant speed : mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the white sox . both are good , daring fielders : mantle covers more ground ; ; maris's throwing arm is stronger . yet with all their skills , the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : the home run . with this ultimate weapon , the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season . ( american league expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams . only two teams in each league ( the yankees and detroit , the dodgers and cincinnati ) are battling for first place . appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment . in 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . something was needed to revive interest ; ; the something was the home run . into washington on president-elect john f. kennedy's convair , the caroline , winged actor-crooner frank sinatra and his close hollywood pal , cinemactor peter lawford , jack kennedy's brother-in-law . also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , frankie and peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth inauguration eve entertainment gala in the capital's national guard armory . frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` it's really tremendous when you think ella fitzgerald is coming from australia . i could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! as the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each . the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself : his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles . soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing . a year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the marine corps , general david m. shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless new year '' greeting to his pentagon staff . said leatherneck shoup : `` a year ago i took the grips of the plow in my hands . after pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , i lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team i ever held a rein on . little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . but shoup also gave the corps a tilling in spots . speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . a few of these people are still around '' . old and new briefly crossed paths in the u.s. senate , then went their respective ways . at a reception for new members of congress , oregon democrat maurine neuberger , taking the senate seat held by her husband richard until his death last march , got a brotherly buss from democratic elder statesman adlai stevenson , u.s. ambassador-designate to the u.n. . meanwhile , after 24 years in the senate , rhode island's durable democrat theodore francis greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last november ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the senate . the most famous undergraduate of south philadelphia high school is a current bobby-sox idol , dreamboat cacophonist fabian ( real name : fabian forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while . the principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in hollywood and philadelphia -- fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in english and mathematics . lacking his needed credits in those subjects , fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . south philadelphia high's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making . to decathlon man rafer johnson ( time cover , aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's olympic games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the a.a.u.'s james e. sullivan memorial trophy as the outstanding u.s. amateur athlete of 1960 . as the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- sports illustrated tapped golf's confident arnold palmer ( time cover , may 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the masters and u.s. open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year . tooling through sydney on his way to race in the new zealand grand prix , britain's balding ace driver stirling moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination . `` i'm a slob '' , he announced . `` my taste is gaudy . i'm useless for anything but racing cars . i'm ruddy lazy , and i'm getting on in years . it gets so frustrating , but then again i don't know what i could do if i gave up racing '' . has moss no stirling virtues ? ? `` i appreciate beauty '' . one of nikita khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the u.s.s.r.'s daily izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed red-prone comedian charlie chaplin at his swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 . chaplin , 71 , who met k. when the soviet boss visited england in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit russia some time this summer because `` i have marveled at your grandiose experiment and i believe in your future '' . then charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the nikita he had glimpsed : `` i was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . g. david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh . there the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . last week , in the german city of dusseldorf , g. david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause . on display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . like philadelphia's late dr. albert c. barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( time , jan. 2 ) , thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . he made his fortune during world war 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . he gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . he was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the museum of modern art's alfred barr said of him : `` i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didn't know about '' . he might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . he could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . he bought up cezannes , braques , matisses , legers , a splendid picasso series , more than 70 giacometti sculptures . he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world . all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stone's throw , outside pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city . but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . pittsburgh turned him down , just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . he went then to a 40-year-old basel art dealer named ernst beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . last year beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of klees to the state of north rhine-westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . last week most of the other prizes , once offered to pittsburgh , went on the block . at the opening of the dusseldorf show , thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . thompson himself said : `` i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . break in georgia the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . but in all its 175 years , not a single negro student has entered its classrooms . last week federal district judge william a. bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' negro boy and girl . their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in georgia -- and in alabama , mississippi and south carolina as well . for 18 months , hamilton holmes , 19 , and charlayne hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . they graduated together from atlanta's turner high school , where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third . the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . holmes went to atlanta's morehouse ( negro ) college , where he is a b student and star halfback . charlayne studied journalism at detroit's wayne state university . last fall , after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court , judge bootle ordered them to apply again . charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state . but holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . the evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . no , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . they also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . their reason : holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes . the real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . judge bootle's decision : `` the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . the state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . `` surprised and pleased '' , students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week . catch for chicago when the university of chicago's chancellor lawrence a. kimpton submitted his resignation last march , a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway . out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . such academic statesmen as james b. conant were consulted . two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors , including adlai stevenson , richard nixon , and harvard's dean mcgeorge bundy . the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as trustee chairman glen a. lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago . last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic geneticist george wells beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( time , cover , july 14 , 1958 ) . it fell to chancellor kimpton , now a standard oil ( indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up chicago after the 21-year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins . he threw out some of hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era . at caltech , geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . but he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; he avidly reads the wall street journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model a ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end . but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . the man was king leopold 2 , of the belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . by force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in central africa . this is an area nearly as large as western europe ; ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; they were determined by the points at which leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . the population of the congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . the religions of the people include christianity , mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done , or failed to do , in the congo since 1885 . at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property . but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . the belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . one definition of paternalism is `` the principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . the colony was administered from brussels , with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote . the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock . in inside africa , john gunther describes one of these , the societe generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the house of morgan , anaconda copper , the mutual life insurance company of new york , the pennsylvania railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the united states government as a heavy partner '' . had they been truly ruthless , the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion . but they were not . they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes ; ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; they put much effort into public housing . they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . but instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? the belgians also placed great emphasis on education . during the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the congo . but almost all the schools were primary . the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . but they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . it was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . indeed , the belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? in one large oversimplification , it might be said that the belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping africa . they lacked time to prepare the congo , as the british and french had prepared their colonies . the congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; and in brussels , street crowds shouted , `` pas une goutte de sang ! ! '' ( not one drop of blood ! ! ) . the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . it is hard to blame them for this . yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . there were four principal ones . first , there were those congolese ( among them joseph kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , balkanizing it . second , there were those ( moise tshombe ) who favored near-balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . third , there were those ( notably patrice lumumba ) who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government . and fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up . however , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration . they had divided the congo into six provinces -- leopoldville , kasai , kivu , katanga , equator and eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . well-wishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . if internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man congolese army , the force publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians . the president , joseph kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , patrice lumumba , a reasonable man . twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . presently the well-armed members of the force publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country . the belgian government decided to act , and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo . on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga , moise tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . confusion became chaos ; ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians , and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them . on july 14 the security council -- with france and great britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the u.n. into the congo . vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretary-general `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( congolese ) government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the government , to meet fully their tasks . '' secretary-general hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the u.n. troops sent into the congo were to come from african , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the u.s. , russia , great britain or france . he quickly called on ghana , tunisia , morocco , guinea and mali , which dispatched troops within hours . ultimately the u.n. army in the congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden , who were the only whites . it took the u.n. three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo . the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed u.n. efforts . the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the u.n. to get out of the congo along with the belgians , and appealed to russia for help . ( however , there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist . before appealing to the u.n. or to russia , he first appealed to the u.s. for military help , and was rejected . ) lumumba further complicated the u.n.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which , under albert kalonji , wanted to secede as well . meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo , sending lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . but by the end of the three-month period , in october 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the congo . president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him . lumumba fired kasavubu . control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of joseph mobutu , chief of staff of the congolese army . mobutu promptly flung out the russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at u.n. headquarters in new york . the belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . but they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga , the seceded province which , according to tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . from october 1960 to february 1961 , the u.n. forces in the congo took little action . there was no directive for it -- the security council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or balkanize it . during the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo . in february the murder of patrice lumumba , who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe , again stirred the u.n. to action . on feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . it also urged that the u.n. eject , and prevent the return of , all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; ordered an investigation of lumumba's death ; ; urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army . the presidency : talking and listening though president john f. kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloy's unexpected report from khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of u.s. foreign policy last week . high up on the president's priority list was the thorny question of bizerte . on this issue , the president received a detailed report from his u.n. ambassador adlai stevenson , who had just returned from paris , and mr. kennedy asked stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both paris and tunis -- out of the imbroglio . ideally , the president would like the french to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base . to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , mr. kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend . the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no. 2 man in the tunisian government , defense minister bahi ladgham , who flew to washington last week to seek u.s. support . the conversation apparently convinced mr. kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable . through ladgham , mr. kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba ; ; and one u.s. official said : `` the key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . on the latin american front , the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the inter-american economic and social council ( which the president himself had originally hoped to attend ) . main purpose of the meeting : to discuss president kennedy's alliance for progress . and that was not all . in conferences with nationalist china's dapper , diminutive vice president chen cheng , mr. kennedy assured chiang kai-shek's emissary that the u.s. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations . chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia ; ; however the president , who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow , would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the u.s. if outer mongolia's admission comes to a vote . the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . to africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , attorney general robert kennedy , on a good-will mission to the ivory coast . all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . crime : ' skyjacked ' from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston , as the great four-jet boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at phoenix , el paso , and san antonio . when continental airlines night-coach flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . the plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in phoenix . thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for el paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . at 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso , passenger robert berry , a san antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . `` the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , berry said . `` i figured he was sick '' . john salvador , a farmer from palm desert , calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . `` the kid had a automatic , like they issue in the army '' , he said . `` the other fellow had a '' . salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey ; ; the man put his at the head of capt. byron d. rickards . to rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when peruvian rebels made him land a ford tri-motor at arequipa . but last week's pirates , like the cuban-american who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra ( newsweek , aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to havana . stalling : `` tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told rickards . the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message . but , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach havana ; ; they would have to refuel at el paso . most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . jerry mccauley of sacramento , calif. , one of some twenty air force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . `` the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba '' , mccauley said , `` and like a nut i raised my hand . i thought he was the air force recruiter '' . what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . they chose four : jack casey , who works for continental airlines in houston ; ; fred mullen from mercer island , wash. ; ; pfc. truman cleveland of st. augustine . fla. , and leonard gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the u.s. immigration service border patrol . everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 4:18 a.m. . they found a large welcoming group -- el paso policemen , border patrol , sheriff's deputies , and fbi men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . other fbi men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana . the ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propeller-driven douglas aj . actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of cuba's fidel castro who had taken over the 707 . mr. kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . at one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot , the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba . as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . from the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being cubans , were native americans , subsequently identified as leon bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from coolidge , ariz. , and his son , cody , 16 , a high-school junior . tension the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens . the father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons . at 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the beardens gave an ultimatum : take off or see the hostages killed . the tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway . several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; the plane slowed to a halt . ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . the day wore on . at 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . a few minutes later , fbi agent francis crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . while crosby distracted the beardens , stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door . so did hostages casey , cleveland , and mullen . that left only the four crew members , crosby , and border patrolman gilman , all unarmed , with the beardens . the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . he caught officer simmons' eye , nodded toward young bearden , and -- `` i swung my right as hard as i could . simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . ( bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro , and live high in cuba . ) back home in coolidge , ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , mary , said : `` i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs '' . congress : more muscle taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation . the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in u.s. history . with the money all but in hand , however , the administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . the `` hold-back '' , as pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . in all , the senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by president kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the president had asked for . ( the senate , on its own , decided to provide additional b-52 and other long-range bombers for the strategic air command . ) the house , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the president's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . in other areas , congressional action last week included : the senate ( by voice vote ) and the house ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign , not too unhappily . the senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend . white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . food : stew a la mulligatawny most members of the u.s. senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . but , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . as a result , ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-american course . individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from michigan , soft-shell crabs from maryland , oysters from washington , grapefruit from florida . but plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late sen. fred dubois of idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the senate's stomach was in the right place . in a daring stroke , the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year french-born maitre d'hotel . holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . other tax-exempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 , according to standard & poor's average . on balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . however , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . on these bonds , price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines . tax-free returns . investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . it's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on u. s. treasury bonds . for investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . swelling traffic . a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in february or march -- shows what is happening . the report is based on a survey by blyth & company , investment bankers . nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . and there is the bright note : the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . indication : the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . look , for example , at the ohio turnpike . traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february , as compared with those same months in 1960 . then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . as a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike . operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in march . costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . for the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . the road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston . slow successes . some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . the 187-mile illinois state toll highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until december , 1958 . in the 12 months ended in february , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . in the 12 months ended in february , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . that improvement is continuing . in the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . in these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . many rate increases already have been put into effect . higher tolls are planned for july 1 , 1961 , on the richmond-petersburg , va. , turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study . easier access . progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . the kansas turnpike offers an illustration . net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb. 28 , 1961 . further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city , kans. , and kansas city , mo. . meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . for some roads , troubles . investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . if nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . these , however , are exceptions . the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . it's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . a top american official , after a look at europe's factories , thinks the u.s. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . commerce secretary luther hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on may 10 toured plants of two of italy's biggest companies -- fiat , the auto producer , and olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . our staff man cabled from turin as follows -- `` follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant , and you learn this : `` one , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the marshall plan -- enables fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . about half of these are exported . `` two , wage costs are a fraction of the u.s. costs . a skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . `` three , labor troubles are infrequent . fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . `` said secretary hodges : ' it's a tough combination for the u.s. to face . `` olivetti had a special interest for hodges . olivetti took over underwood , the u.s. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . within a year , without reducing wages , underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled . `` the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout , modern machinery . the firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . `` hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u.s. . the inflow of foreign capital would help the u.s. balance of payments . `` hodges predicted : ' i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u.s. . there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines . important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these : an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy . chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . the u.s. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . if they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . at the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the u.s. . hong kong , india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the `` lancashire pact '' . none of these countries is happy with these arrangements . the japanese want to increase exports to the u.s. while they have been curbing shipments , they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u.s. market . hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain , while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly . the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons . the kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in asia and europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what president kennedy wants . this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . it's an important clue to washington thinking . note , too , that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the u.s. textile industry . `` get competitive or get out '' . in veiled terms , that's what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry . the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . government research will look into new products and methods . import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . but the kennedy administration doesn't favor import quotas . rather , they are impressed with the british government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . what's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . among the highest-paid workers in the world are u.s. coal miners . yet u.s. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . steel company of wales , a british steelmaker , wants to bring in virginia coal , cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . virginia coal , delivered by ship in wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . u.s. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . productivity of u.s. miners is twice that of the british . welsh coal miners , communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal . they threaten to strike . the british government will have to decide whether to let u.s. coal in . the british coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` i'm sorry , but we don't have that book . there wouldn't be much demand for it , i'm afraid '' . behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . what to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? what to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . in some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the new york co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . it was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . some library boards are wary of the plan . a large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . a small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . all services are given without cost to members . so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . to set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . the collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . in nassau county , for example , the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . this system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . on microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . east meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; history , biography , and education are centered in hempstead ; ; levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; while hewlett-woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . this kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . the system passes on these savings to its members . further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . books are not the only resource of the system . schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . the most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` nanook of the north '' , `` the emperor's nightingale '' , and `` the red balloon '' . workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; and it publishes sum and substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . the system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . in nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans , the teen-agers . to them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` i'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world . the need for lifetime reading is apparent . education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; if we do not know how to use what we do read . we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . although progress has been made in america's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america . the problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . there are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . in college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the u.s. office of education . and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . in every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . only public understanding and support can provide that service . this is one of the main reasons for national library week , april 16-22 , and for its theme : `` for a richer , fuller life , read '' ! !\n"

            "the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced  no evidence  that any irregularities took place  the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee  which had overall charge of the election   deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta  for the manner in which the election was conducted  the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible  irregularities  in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr   only a relative handful of such reports was received   the jury said   considering the widespread interest in the election  the number of voters and the size of this city   the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws  are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous   it recommended that fulton legislators act  to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them   the grand jury commented on a number of other topics  among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said  are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments   merger proposed however  the jury said it believes  these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration   the city purchasing department  the jury said   is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies   it urged that the city  take steps to remedy  this problem  implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury  it urged that the next legislature  provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected   the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes   this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program   the jury said  but the state welfare department  has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county  which receives none of this money  the jurors said they realize  a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties   nevertheless   we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds   the jurors said   failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden  on fulton taxpayers  the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers  guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation  wards protected the jury said it found the court  has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations  of two previous grand juries  the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee   these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms   the jury said  regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport  the jury recommended  that when the new management takes charge jan 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences   the jury did not elaborate  but it added that  there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable   ask jail deputies on other matters  the jury recommended that   1  four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and  a doctor  medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail    2  fulton legislators  work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable  pension plan for city employes  the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department  the fulton tax commissioners office  the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms  grady hospital and the fulton health department  mayor william b hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife  pearl williams hartsfield  in fulton superior court friday  his petition charged mental cruelty  the couple was married aug 2  1913  they have a son  william berry jr  and a daughter  mrs j m cheshire of

listed on the petition as the mayors attorney  hartsfield has been mayor of atlanta  with exception of one brief interlude  since 1937  his political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923  the mayors present term of office expires jan 1  he will be succeeded by ivan allen jr  who became a candidate in the sept 13 primary after mayor hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection  georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governors race  a top official said wednesday  robert snodgrass  state gop chairman  said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience  state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker  in the blue ridge meeting  the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters  despite the warning  there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate  according to republicans who attended  when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race  it voted no  and there were no dissents  the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race  one of two alternative courses must be taken  1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot  or 2 the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system  a system which the party opposes in its platform  sam caldwell  state highway department public relations director  resigned tuesday to work for lt gov garland byrds campaign  caldwells resignation had been expected for some time  he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville  who has been an assistant more than three years  when the gubernatorial campaign starts  caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd  the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home  where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly  before adjournment monday afternoon  the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made  gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment  vandiver likely will mention the 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item  construction bonds meanwhile  it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds  the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act  and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways  a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some 3 million to 4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work  a revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities  vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin  the highway department source told the constitution  however  that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds  schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a 10 per day increase in expense allowances  pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the  quickie  vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought  while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out  pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 8731  a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 295  as of sunday night  there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action  pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions  a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education  something it has consistently opposed in the past  rep mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to  endorse increased federal support for public education  provided that such funds be received and expended  as state funds  barber  who is in his 13th year as a legislator  said there  are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it  the resolution  passed   but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution  the resolution  which barber tossed into the house hopper friday  will be formally read monday  it says that  in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds   the state board of education should be directed to  give priority  to teacher pay raises  colquitt  after a long  hot controversy  miller county has a new school superintendent  elected  as a policeman put it  in the  coolest election i ever saw in this county   the new school superintendent is harry davis  a veteran agriculture teacher  who defeated felix bush  a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee  davis received 1119 votes in saturdays election  and bush got 402  ordinary carey williams  armed with a pistol  stood by at the polls to insure order   this was the coolest  calmest election i ever saw   colquitt policeman tom williams said   being at the polls was just like being at church  i didnt smell a drop of liquor  and we didnt have a bit of trouble   the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet  however  it was marked by controversy  anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence  the former county school superintendent  george p callan  shot himself to death march 18  four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board  during the election campaign  both candidates  davis and bush  reportedly received anonymous telephone calls  ordinary williams said he  too  was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election  many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls  and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election  sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise   everything went real smooth   the sheriff said   there wasnt a bit of trouble   austin  texas  committee approval of gov price daniels  abandoned property  act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers  daniel personally led the fight for the measure  which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures  in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation  under committee rules  it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week  but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it  daniel termed  extremely conservative  his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug 31  he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books  since texas was a republic   it permits the state to take over bank accounts  stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more  the bill  which daniel said he drafted personally  would force banks  insurance firms  pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer  the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property  daniel declared  dewey lawrence  a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association  sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers   if you destroy confidence in banks  you do something to the economy   he said   you take out of circulation many millions of dollars   rep charles e hughes of sherman  sponsor of the bill  said a failure to enact it would amount  to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks  insurance and pipeline companies   his contention was denied by several bankers  including scott hudson of sherman  gaynor b jones of houston  j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin  cox argued that the bill is  probably unconstitutional  since  he said  it would impair contracts  he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing  since the bill was introduced only last monday  austin  texas  senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of sen george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties  the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state  there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house  it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population  require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools  permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here  operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas  harris  bexar  tarrant and el paso would be 451500  which would be a savings of 157460 yearly after the first years capital outlay of 88000 was absorbed  parkhouse told the senate  the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county  saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school  dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e  red  berry and joe ratcliff  while details are still to be worked out  ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected   were getting more  pro  letters than  con  on horse race betting   said ratcliff   but i believe if people were better informed on this question  most of them would oppose it also  im willing to stake my political career on it   rep berry  an exgambler from san antonio  got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies  a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report  although the resolution faces hard sledding later  the house passed finally  and sent to the senate  a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities  the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees  passing the three on the calendar  one validated acts of school districts  another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district  the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district  for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted  without dissent  senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district  money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site  two tax revision bills were passed  one  by sen louis crump of san saba  would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized  instead  retailers would sign a certificate of correctness  violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison  plus a 1000 fine  it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league  the other bill  by sen a m aikin jr of paris  would relieve real estate brokers  who pay their own annual licensing fee  from the 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds  natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain  under a bill by sen frank owen 3  of el paso  to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas  marshall formby of plainview  former chairman of the texas highway commission  suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress  eliminating the need for costly special elections  under formbys plan  an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor  lieutenant governor  speaker of the house  attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court  austin  texas  state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay  an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot  when texas votes on a us senator  rep wesley roberts of seminole  sponsor of the poll idea  said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill  the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb 22  the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval  by twothirds majorities  before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot  roberts said  opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice  all dallas members voted with roberts  except rep bill jones  who was absent  austin  texas  paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday  rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise  a wise county hamlet of 250 people  when the shouting ended  the bill passed  114 to 4  sending it to the senate  where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas  most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse  the bill would increase from 5000000 to 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project  cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas  statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds  and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill  did not sway cottens attack  the bills defenders were mostly smalltown legislators like j w buchanan of dumas  eligio  kika  de la garza of mission  sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs   this is a poor boys bill   said chapman   dallas and fort worth can vote bonds  this would help the

of adc to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 44 million dollars  said c virgil martin  president of carson pirie scott  co  committee chairman   we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence   martin said  the volume of adc cases will decrease  martin reported  when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems  relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color  these  he said  are  two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc   calls for extension other recommendations made by the committee are  extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives  including both parents  as a means of preserving family unity  research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy  several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest  judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday  the disclosure by charles bellows  chief defense counsel  startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial  bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client  alan clements  30  a separate trial  bellows made the request while the allwoman jury was out of the courtroom  fears prejudicial aspects  the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client   bellows told the court   some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property  it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others   judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired   you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this     yes  your honor   replied bellows   what this amounts to  if true  is that there will be a freeforall fight in this case  there is a conflict among the defendants   washington  july 24  president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio  the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone  shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port  mass  a white house spokesman said the address text still had  quite a way to go  toward completion  decisions are made asked to elaborate  pierre salinger  white house press secretary  replied   i would say its got to go thru several more drafts   salinger said the work president kennedy  advisers  and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording  rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city  the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns  who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence  by unfair and fundamentally illegal means   karns said that the cases involved a matter  of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence  of the 50 persons  he said evidence was obtained  in violation of the legal rights of citizens   karns ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases  in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been  unable to make a case   contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j wexler  special prosecutor  issue jury subpoenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation  questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building  but did not take them before the grand jury  mayer goldberg  attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward  argued this procedure constituted intimidation  wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning  karns said it was a  wrongful act  for wexler to take statements  privately and outside of the grand jury room   he said this constituted a  very serious misuse  of the criminal court processes   actually  the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county  altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court   said karns  who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court  faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons  wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with  complementary  miscount of the vote  in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another  the cases involved judges in the 33d  24th  and 42d precincts of the 31st ward  the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward  the 18th precinct of the 4th ward  and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward  the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns  two other cases also were under advisement  claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case  karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed  he would dismiss them  washington  feb 9  president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 142 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs  the president  in a special message to congress  tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships  build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools  and expand child health care and general medical research  the aged care plan  similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator  a fight on capitol hill  it was defeated in congress last year  cost up to 37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes  the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent  3 per cent on each worker and employer  on the first 4800 of pay per year  the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5000 a year and the payroll tax to 65 per cent  325 per cent each  similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system  the payroll tax would actually rise to 75 per cent starting jan 1  1963  if the plan is approved  because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs  outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 15 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year  1963  both figures would go higher in later years  other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years  these would be paid for out of general  not payroll  taxes  nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems  1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness  except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days  2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital  a patient could receive up to 300 days paidfor nursing home care under a  unit formula  allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit  3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient  4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness  the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged  calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to  meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense  but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings  or those of their children  caused by an extended hospital stay    this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs   he said   and with sufficient  deductible  requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals   this is not a program of socialized medicine  it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed  every person will choose his own doctor and hospital   wouldnt pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills  they would still be paid by the patient  apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships  and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools  the president said the nations 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care  moreover  he said  many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs  contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1500 a year for onefourth of the first year students  the schools could use the money to pay 4year scholarships  based on need  of up to 2000 a year per student  in addition  the government would pay a 1000  cost of education  grant to the schools for each 1500 in scholarship grants  officials estimated the combined programs would cost 51 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966  the president recommended federal  matching grants  totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones  more for nursing homes in the area of  community health services   the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction  he asked for another 10 million dollar  initial  appropriation for  stimulatory grants  to states to improve nursing homes  he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals  in the child health field  the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau  he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute  asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation  he did not say by how much  for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase  from 30 to 50 millions  in matching grants for building research facilities  the president said he will also propose increasing  by an unspecified amount  the 540 million dollars in the 196162 budget for direct government research in medicine  the president said his proposals combine the  indispensable elements in a sound health program  people  knowledge  services  facilities  and the means to pay for them   reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines  legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan  those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message  senate republican leader dirksen  ill  and house republican leader charles halleck  ind  said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance  halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first  house speaker sam rayburn  d  tex  called the kennedy program  a mighty fine thing   but made no prediction on its fate in the house  washington  feb 9  acting hastily under white house pressure  the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief  only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote  a number of scattered  ayes  and  noes  was heard  customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency  in the last eight years  all presidential appointments  including those of cabinet rank  have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor  enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse  d  ore  in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedys in 1961  oslo the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer  franker  and wider discussions  animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings  this has been a working session of an organization that  by its very nature  can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes  in oslo  the ministers have met in a climate of candor  and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems  this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never  or not for a long time  had such problems  the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa  exacerbated by the difficulties  changes  and tragedies facing them  and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about  has been conspicuous by its absence  explosion avoided in the case of portugal  which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh  there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension  the general  remarkably courteous  explanation has left basic positions unchanged  but there has been no explosion in the council  there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes  since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance  canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive  even norway  despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance  is today closer to the nato line  on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for  one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as  inconclusive   but he hastened to add that  if united states policies were not always clear  despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west  this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy  exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair  with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited  the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days  despite mr rusks personal popularity  that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind  more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots  the secretary of state himself  in his first speech  gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months  but where the core of nato is concerned  the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance   cornerstone  of its foreign policy  but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters  the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin  an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole  conflict surveyed the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction  wherever it take place around the globe  is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies  and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection  the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions  more  deeper  and more timely political consultation within the alliance  the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development  when ratified  as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries  and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent  this increase in the  threshold   as the conventional forces strengthening is called  will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come  each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down  but never completely fulfilled  washington the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time  there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos  the united states  state department officials explain  now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam  they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this  the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated  but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility  policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos  rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference  this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make  it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration  its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas  but with the months moving on  and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world  the question arises  how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression   former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union  he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory  gop restrained it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it  they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans  if they had been in power  would have made  amateurish and monumental blunders  in cuba  one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score  his reply  he said  was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now  but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first  the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton  r  of kentucky  chairman of the republican national committee  that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination  kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard  boston university  brandeis  and massachusetts institute of technology educators  detente urged this group pleads with the administration to  give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups   it recommends that the united states  seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations   and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds   mr nixon  for his part  would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation  but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated  until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos  almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected  generally  the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors  aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels  a high official source disclosed  that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration  strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements  policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed  but thus far there has been no response in kind  foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations  in laos  the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture  again and again it asked the communists to  freeze  the military situation in laos  but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate  and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup  administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a  great service  and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization  seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos  but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos   some seato nations disagreed  however   there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally  unlike its more determined neighbors  thailand and south viet nam  the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos  the prowestern government  which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma  neutralist  government  never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army  there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt  if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma  whom it felt was too trusting of communists  it gradually had to relinquish them  one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright  d  of arkansas  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by  encouraging the removal  of prince souvanna  washington the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states  the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the  vitality of the nation   in an important assertion of national leadership in this field  he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime  to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems  the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend  offenses multiply the president has also called upon the attorney general  the secretary of health  education and welfare  and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts  in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem  simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett  a special assistant to the attorney general  as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime  his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948  each year showing an increase in offenders  among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959  about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age  east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director  raymond h hawksley  the present city cd head  believes  mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time  east providence now has no civil defense program  mr hawksley  the states general treasurer  has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years  he is not interested in being named a fulltime director  noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program  mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director  he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about 3500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs  mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job  one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin  he said  along with a director  the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized  mr hawksley said  one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director  he said  is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program  matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios  sirens and rescue trucks  he said  mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks  similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station  he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area  speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city  mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack  the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point  he said  and a drivein theater in seekonk would be another  riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point  mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack  such vital information  he said  has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know  if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director  mr hawksley said  then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally  one of the first things he would do  he said  would be to organize classes in first aid  other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government  rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind  governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly  the governors move into the socalled  blue law  controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant  deputy city clerk of central falls  a copy was released to the press  mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant  the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature  while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review  mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get  the benefit of his views   he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation  the governor said   i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings   mr notte said   to obtain the views of the general public and religious  labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws   the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time  with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales   the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws  should there be evidence they are shirking  he has said  the state police will step into the situation  there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws  the statutes  similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times  severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath  the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday  the only day they  have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday   the councils resolution said  the small shops  must be retained  for they provide essential service to the community   according to the resolution  which added that they  also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors   it declares that sunday sales licenses provide  great revenue  to the local government  the council advised the governor that  large supermarkets  factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business  on sunday  they  operate on a volume basis   it was contended   and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community   liberals and conservatives in both parties  democratic and republican  should divorce themselves and form two independent parties  george h reama  nationally known labormanagement expert  said here yesterday  mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the  welfare  type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system  he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day  he said he was  confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910   that  he added  was when he was  a very young man  a machinist and toolmaker by trade   that was before i studied law  some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party  the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track  he steered me to the right track  the free enterprise track   he said that when he was a socialist in 1910  the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources  he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory  most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties  mr reama  who retired as vice president of the american screw co in 1955 said   both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product  but neither told us how to achieve it   he said he favors wage increases for workers   but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze   and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices  he added  indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy  mr reama said   a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own   mr reama  far from really being retired  is engaged in industrial relations counseling  a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town  william a martinelli  chairman of the citizens group of johnston  transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr  the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post  mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days  he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work  a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier  town solicitor  over the exact manner in which the vote is handled  mr martinelli has  in recent weeks  been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote  while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead  mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures  he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible  mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement  he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present  but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes   after inspiring this  i think we should certainly follow through on it   he declared   it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement   he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission   our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement   he indicated   and to tell them what this will mean for the town   he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september  some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday  with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter  increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks  it was indicated  misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed  false pretenses   several signers affixed their names  it was learned  after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system  action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at mondays special north providence town council meeting  council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance  at the last session of the general assembly  the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective  nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation  at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition  local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense  plainfield  james p mitchell and sen walter h jones rbergen  last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes  democratic gubernatorial candidate  that the gop is  campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism   mitchell was for using it  jones against  and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel  the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club  it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs  hughes said monday   it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism  but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired  now hes gone  the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state   sunday he had added   we can love eisenhower the man  even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership   mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign   how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this    he asked  the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican  and proud to have absorbed his philosophy  while working in his adminstration  mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue  regrets attack jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president   he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign   he said   because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into rearguing an old national campaign   the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark  dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary  he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign  state aid to schools  the continuance of railroad passenger service  the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority  and making new jersey attractive to new industry  decries joblessness mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate  must share the blame for this   noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant  he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform   but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time   mitchell said  jones  unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions  saved his barbs for mitchell  he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises   he calls for help while saying he is against centralization  but you cant have it both ways   jones said  the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities  real estate or motor vehicles  he said   and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue   defends ike earlier  mitchell said in a statement   i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes  his reference to  discredited carcass  or  tattered remains  of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history  to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states  and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations   i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste   such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature  it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit   sees jones ahead sen charles w sandman  rcape may  said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination  sandman  state campaign chairman for jones  was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel  newark  of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones  sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years  sandman said   the announcement that sen clifford case aj  has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway  it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems   we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington  that failed   we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year  that  too  will fail   sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave  westfield  as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee  mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman  county supervisor weldon r sheets  who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination  today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them  the proposal  sheets said  represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a  lip service word   sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines  enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10year period without interest or charge  sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january  1964  although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful  he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines  the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange  for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county  was supported today by edward w roos  west orange public safety commissioner  sheeran  a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organizations candidate  freeholder william macdonald  for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy  now a member of the state board of tax appeals   my experience as public safety commissioner   roos said   has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience  and preferably one who is a lawyer  jim sheeran fits that description   trenton  william j seidel  state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development  has retired after 36 years of service  a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state  seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies  in october 1944  he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section  under his supervision  the state firefighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting  he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station  he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens  he is credited with setting up an annual cooperative fire prevention program in cooperation with the red cross and state department of education  boonton  richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge  to carry the issues to every corner of the state   he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn   when i come back here after the november election youll think   youre my man  youre the kind of governor were glad we elected    he said   we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just  and not what is expedient at the time   attacks republicans in his only attack on the republicans  hughes said   the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary  but well have a liberal  well planned  forward looking  honest platform  well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson   well take the truth to the people  and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november   he said   you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration  but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead   he urged new jersey to  become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy   he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states  and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry   we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean   the former superior court judge said   to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s   calling the democrats the  party that lives  breathes and thinks for the good of the people   hughes asked   a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november   hughes supported gov meyners  green acres  plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development  he said legislation for a 60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday  conservation plan the plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state  the other 15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis  hughes said   this is not a plan to conquer space  but to conserve it   pointing out the state population has increased 125000 each year since 1950  he said  morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas  there will be no land left to preserve   hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved  he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans   after the primary   he promised   ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong  dynamic administration  im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee   trenton  fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring  voluntarily  this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues  the outgoing members  whose fouryear terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election  received carved wooden elephants  complete with ivory tusks  to remember the state committee by  there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18  but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters  a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank  who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee  she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the womens suffrage amendment  she served one fouryear term on the national committee  resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates  at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable  some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years  the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders  some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party  opposition reported some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept 7 democratic primary  these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city  their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor  in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate  mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley  the bronx democratic leader  and with joseph t sharkey  the brooklyn democratic leader  mayor visits buckley as usual  he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio  the manhattan leader  he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party  last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation  apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organizations acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle  in talks with mr buckley last week in washington  the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa  who lives in the bronx  from this years ticket  but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor  screvane and beame hailed the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane  who lives in queens  to replace abe stark  the incumbent  as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame  who lives in brooklyn  to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller  the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx  after his speech  reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions  published in yesterdays new york times  the mayor said   it didnt come from me  but as i have said before  if i announce my candidacy  i will have something definite to say about running mates   boston  june 16  a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts  there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics  the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are  all the same    its  see joe  see jim    he says   the hand is out   a political scientist writes of the growth of  alienated voters   who  believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt  selfish and beyond popular control  these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy  the object of which is to plunder them   corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel   the last hurrah   but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject  a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year  graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations  and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state  a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery  or worse  is the norm in massachusetts public life  day after day some new episode is reported  the state public works department is accused of having spent 8555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property  an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate  washington  june 18  congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers  in the senate  several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition  in the house  the southernrepublican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administrations housing bill  while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aidtoeducation bill  the housing bill is now in the house rules committee  it is expected to be reported out tuesday  but this is a little uncertain  the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble  democrat of arkansas  who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor  mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday  leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans  the democratic leadership  however  hopes to pass it sometime this week  the 6100000000 measure  which was passed last monday by the senate  provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families  it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories  the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee  where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy  they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts  three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958  this would provide for longterm federal loans for construction of parochial and other privateschool facilities for teaching science  languages and mathematics  mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee  about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups  according to an official of the corps  in the 40000000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval  26000000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies  twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contractnegotiation stage  gordon boyce  director of relations with the voluntary agencies  said in a washington interview  six of these were proposed by religious groups  they will be for teaching  agriculture and community development in southeast asia  africa  the middle east and latin america  question raised interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods  means and goals  there are a number of ways this could happen  the churchmen pointed out  and here is an example  last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled  when he protested  the hotel owner said   why do you worry   the u s government is paying for it  the u s government pays for all its overseas workers   missionary explains  i dont work for the government   the american said   im a missionary   the hotel owner shrugged   same thing   he said  and then  some churchmen remarked  there is a more classical churchstate problem  can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state   r sargent shriver jr  director of the corps  is certain that they can  no religious group  he declared in an interview  will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes  moscow  june 18  at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia  premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said  beaming   look  he took everything i had    mr khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker  indonesia is one of the twenty underdeveloped countries of asia  africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid  the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic  technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations  the communist countries allocated more than 1000000000 in economic aid alone last year  according to western estimates  this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the underdeveloped countries made its modest beginning in 1954  in 1960 more than 6000 communist technicians were present in those countries  united nations  n y  june 18  a committee of experts has recommended that a countrys population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations  this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations  one effect of the proposal  which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength  as in the past  would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india  india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400000000 inhabitants  the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report  the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations  formula is due this week the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week  the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines  each of the organizations ninetynine members would get two professional posts  such as political affairs officer  a department head or an economist  to start  each member would get one post for each 10000000 people in its population up to 150000000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts  each member with a population above 150000000 would get one additional post for each additional 30000000 people up to an unspecified cutoff point  geneva  june 18  the three leaders of laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the warridden kingdom  the decision was made in zurich by prince boun oum  premier of the prowestern royal government   prince souvanna phouma  leader of the nations neutralists and recognized as premier by the communist bloc  and prince souphanouvong  head of the procommunist pathet lao forces  the latter two are halfbrothers  their joint statement was welcomed by the western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteennation conference on the future of laos  an agreement among the princes on a coalition government would ease their task  diplomats conceded  but no one was overly optimistic  tactics studied in geneva w averell harriman of the united states  malcolm macdonald of britain  maurice couve de murville  frances foreign minister  and howard c green  canadas minister

phoumas young daughter  read the princes statement  they had a twohour luncheon together in  an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation   she said  the three laotians agreed upon a sixpoint agenda for their talks  which are to last three days  the princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days  to deal with principles the meetings in zurich  the statement said  would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition government  appointment of william s pfaff jr  41  as promotion

washington  thousands of bleachertype seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan 20  assuming the weather is halfway decent that day  hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f kennedy and retiring president dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oathtaking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route  pennsylvania avenue  named for one of the original 13 states  perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint  but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it  many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the united states governments tremendous buildings  plus shrines and monuments  of course  1600 pennsylvania  the white house  is the most famous address of the free world  within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue  begins a series of great federal buildings  some a block long and all about sevenstories high  great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue  now about 169 years old  in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade  they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote  in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time  seats on square along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this countrys most valuable records are kept  also the department of justice building is located where j edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation  street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania  powered with lines that are underground  many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square  opposite the white house  in this historic square are several statues  but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen andrew jackson  hero of the battle of new orleans  moving past the presidential viewing stand

trust territories and the canal zone  jackson  miss  what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi   even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time  no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the states immediate political future  this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants  gov ross barnett  barnett  who came into office with no previous experience in public administration  has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well  consequently  it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year  could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far  the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office  there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session  it will really throw his administration into a scramble  certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful  honeymoon  he had in the 1960 legislative session  if barnett doesnt call a special session in 1961  it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session  the odds favor a special session  more than likely early in the year  districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session  whether for the companionship or the 2250 per diem is not certain  and if they start agitating  barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure  the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat  with eyes focused on the third congressional district  the historic delta district  and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go  the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature  mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961  with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house  split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents  the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck  and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together  future clouded barnett  as the titular head of the democratic party  apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary  with a democratic administration  party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election  now  the picture is clouded  and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis  who remained loyal to the ticket  are uncertain of their status  reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen  baton rouge  la  the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961  with the governors theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses  the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue  but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue  that of finances in state government  the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress  in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent  the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy  since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program  but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation  legislators weary indeed  the administrations curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat  the administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a grantinaid program  the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote  the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes  davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy  if it fails to pass  he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration  he could terminate special sessions of the legislature  actually  davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway  many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration  this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly  they would like to convey the notion something is being done  even though it is something they know to be ineffectual  underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition  he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle  then he could tell them to go home  while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period  it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million  since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one  but if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a grantinaid program  a not unlikely conclusion  it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes  this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration  the shortage of cash  it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year  if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill  or any other tax bill  it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma  since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session  the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues  constant problem in either case  it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser  the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor  it is one that most try to avoid  as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem  but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off  it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature  this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature  so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year  a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize  any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves  the new year might see some housecleaning  either genuine or token  depending upon developments  to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms  city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside track  with the city  estimates of the citys loss in the 344000 job have ranged as high as 200000  shortcuts unnoticed hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the  legitimate  bids of competing contractors  the hughes concern then took  shortcuts  on the project but got paid anyway  hemphill said  the controllers charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday  the city has sued for the full amount of the 172400 performance bond covering the contract  the philadelphia transportation co is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project  the signature of harold v varani  former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property  appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project  varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor  managing director donald c wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter  the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959  concern bankrupt the hughes company and the consolidated industries  inc  both of 3646 n 2d st  filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law  on monday  the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization  business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c crumlish  jr  intervenes in case the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms  travelers indemnity co and the continental casualty co  at bergers direction  the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u s district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there   i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated   berger said  the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work

army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen gursel as president  gen gursel has headed the military junta the last

economically  e m martin  assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night  martin  who has been in office in washington  d c  for 13 months spoke at the councils annual meeting at the multnomah hotel  he told some 350 persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways  following their own paths   we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which  if not identical  is congenial with ours   he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty  patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice  he said  was the biggest detriment to the soviet union  he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in  and added   so long as people rebel  we must not give up   martin called for patience on the part of americans   the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build   he said  by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare  he said  individual help best  we have no reason to fear failure  but we must be extraordinarily patient   the assistant secretary said  economically  martin said  the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves  private business is more effective than government aid  he explained  because individuals are able to work with the people themselves  the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country  at what he termed a  social cost   martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country  the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portlands civil defense more plans for the citys schools in event of attack  but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go  and whose advice it should follow  the board members  after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar  1409 sw maplecrest dr  said they thought they had already been cooperating  chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem  in case of atomic attack  but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go  dr melvin w barnes  superintendent  said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership  perhaps on the national level  to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would  be more fruitful   and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district   los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster   he said   nobody really expects to evacuate  i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following  mrs molvar  who kept reiterating her request that they  please take a stand   said   we must have faith in somebody  on the local level  and it wouldnt be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children   dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans  even for a high school where there were lots of cars  might not be realistic and would not work   mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowes program  the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting  it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done  is going to be done and what it thought should be done  salem  ap   the statewide meeting of war

to strengthen  the denominations 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966  the changes  unanimously adopted  were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible  the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible  at the adoption  the rev t f zimmerman  general superintendent  commented   the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has  without compromise  stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives   new point added many changes involved minor editing and clarification   however  the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list  the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination  now reads   the scriptures  both old and new testament  are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man  the infallible  authoritative rule of faith and conduct   the third belief  in six points  emphasizes the diety of the lord jesus christ  and   emphasizes the virgin birth  the sinless life of christ  his miracles  his substitutionary work on the cross  his bodily resurrection from the dead  and his

england  we have 60   we need 100 in rhode island  we have none   he said  to step up the denominations program  the rev mr brandt suggested the vision of 8000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years  to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods  he said   church meets change   the churchs ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the

years   moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury  he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee  then played 77 minutes in 1956  his statistical record that year  when texas won only one game and lost nine  was far from impressive  he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards  punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards  he went into the army in march  1957  and returned two years later  but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season  place kicking is largely a matter of timing  moritz declared   once you get the feel of it  theres not much to it  ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel  practice helps you to get your timing down   its kind of like golf  if you dont swing a club very often  your timing gets off   moritz  however  kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session   if you kick too much  your leg gets kinda dead   he explained  footnotes  in their first three games  the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times  or 40 per cent   their total passing yardage in three games  447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts  is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959  when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries  tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season  when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries   he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games  saxton has made only one secondhalf appearance this season and that was in the washington state game  for four plays  he returned the kickoff 30 yards  gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench  wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists hell be ready for oklahoma  last week  when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conferences top four in rushing  he said   that wont last long   it didnt   monday  he had four longhorns in the top four  a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday  but attention quickly turned from saturdays victory to next weeks problem  rice university  the mustangs dont play this week   were just real happy for the players   coach bill meek said of the 97 victory over the air force academy   i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on  it was the first time weve been ahead this season  when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal    assistant coach john cudmore described victory as  a good feeling  i think  on the part of the coaches and the players  we needed it and we got it   meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon  both turned in top jobs for the second straight game   nelson played magnificent football   meek praised   he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times  and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown  he broke that boy  air force fullback nick arshinkoff  in two and knocked him loose from the football   gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages  one was on a fourthdown screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannons territory   as soon as it started to form  gannon spotted it   meek said   he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy  halfback terry isaacson  had time to turn around  he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss   the air forces  and the games  final play  was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards   he just lay back there and waited for it   meek said   he almost brought it back all the way   except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice  meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice   kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game   meek said   hell be out of action all this week  he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game  there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee   rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland   hes looking a lot better  and hes able to run   meek explained   well let him do a lot of running this week  but i dont know if hell be able to play   the game players saw the air force film monday  ran for 30 minutes  then went in  while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes   well work hard tuesday  wednesday and thursday   meek said   and probably will have a good scrimmage friday  well work out about an hour on saturday  then well work monday and tuesday of next week  then taper off   smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday  oct 21  huddle hearsay  held out of texas techs sweatsuits drill monday at lubbock was tackle richard stafford  who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the raiders 387 loss to texas a  m because of its important game with arkansas coming up saturday  baylor worked out in the rain monday  mud or no mud  end gene raesz  who broke a hand in the owls game with lsu  was back working out with rice monday  and john nichols  sophomore guard  moved back into action after a weeks idleness with an ankle injury  the texas aggies got a day off monday  a special gift from coach jim myers for its conference victory last saturday night  but myers announced that halfback george hargett  shaken up in the tech game  would not play against trinity saturday  halfback bud priddy  slowed for almost a month by a slowlymending sprained ankle  joined tcus workout monday  the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts  a 1912 triumph over the denver broncos  but their visit will be a short one  the texans have two more road games  at buffalo and houston  before they play for the home folks again  and it looks as if coach hank strams men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in preseason reckonings  buffalo coach buster ramsey  who has become one of the games greatest collectors of quarterbacks  apparently now has found a productive pair in two exnational football leaguers  m c reynolds and warren rabb  rabb  the former louisiana state field general  came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 2212 upset victory over the houston oilers  defending league champions   just our luck    exclaimed stram   buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way   ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself  for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver  and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star  jack spikes  though he did the teams placekicking while nursing a knee injury   our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well   said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game   in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job   the texans won the game through ball control  with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes   we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack   explained stram   they can be going along  doing little damage  then bang  bang  they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble   the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans  but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off  the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes  the flashy halfback  he was called upon 26 times  more than all of the other ballcarriers combined  and delivered 145 yards  the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denvers al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson  the speedy halfback  hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas  a quick touchdown resulted   that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away   said stram  quipping   i think ill put that play in the book   the early southwest conference football leaders  texas  arkansas and texas a  m  made a big dent in the statistics last week  texas 545yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3game total offense of 1512 yards  1065 rushing and 447 passing  a new swc high  arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing  on 5 completions in 7 tosses  and a tough defense to whip tcu  and a  m  with a 38point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950  completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards  the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards  texas leads in pergame rushing averages  355 yards  and passing 149  to baylors 126   but idle baylor has the best defensive record  1875 yards per game to texas 189   a  m has the best defense against passes  347 yards per game  not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use  the major leagues have ordered their own tests  which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology  rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis  53  the husky 63  205pound lefthander  was in command all the way before an onthescene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area  it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight  they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack  nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning  he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings  an unusual characteristic for a southpaw  the bears took the lead in the first inning  as they did in sundays opener  and never lagged  dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bears attack  after al paschal gruonded out  jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe  alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left  jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don werts smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout  the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner  paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzers glove  nischwitz was working on a 3hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth  chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner  cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines infield roller accounted for the tallies  the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusiks double and outfield flies by porter and wert  gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth  despite the 45degree weather the game was clicked off in 148  thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play  chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusiks grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base  bingles and bobbles  cliff cook accounted for three of the tribes eight hits  it was the seasons first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order  the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark  mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ  among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer  patti waggin who is mrs don rudolph when off the stage  lefty wyman carey  another denver rookie  will be on the mound against veteran john tsitouris at 8 oclock tuesday night  ed donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn  dallas  tex  may 1   ap   kenny lane of muskegon  mich  worlds seventh ranked lightweight  had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over rip randall of tyler  tex  here monday night  st paulminneapolis  may 1   ap   billy gardners line double  which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field  drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 65 victory over the chicago white sox monday  lemon was on with his fourth single of the game  a liner to center  he came all the way around on gardners hit before 5777 fans  it was gardners second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year  turk lown was tagged with the loss  his second against no victories  while ray moore won his second game against a single loss  the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny greens double to left  the white sox had taken a 54 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits  a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon  a walk and a sacrifice fly  jim landis 380foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 10 lead  but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard  al smiths 340blast over left in the fourth  his fourth homer of the campaign  tied the score and carreons first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front  a double by green  allisons runscoring 2baser  an infield single by lemon and gardners solid single to center put the twins back in front in the last of the fifth  ogden  utah  may 1   ap   boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball   ive had it   he told a newsman   i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any 25th man on the ball club   this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout  jensen got only six hits in 46 atbats for a batting average in the first 12 games  he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday  without an official word to anybody  and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno  nev  where his wife  former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen  awaited  she said  when she learned jackie was heading home   im just speculating  but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances   the union pacific railroad streamliner  city of san francisco  stopped in ogden  utah  for a few minutes  sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him  the conductor said to ritchie   i dont think you want to talk to him  youll probably get a ball bat on the head  hes mad at the world   but jackie had gone into the station  ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand   i told him who i was and he was quite cold  but he warmed up after a while  i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a doublecrosser and said anything he  liston  got was through a keyhole  he said he had never talked to liston   liston is bill liston  baseball writer for the boston traveler  who quoted jensen as saying   i cant hit anymore  i cant run  i cant throw  suddenly my reflexes are gone  just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging  and so it was over the weekend what with 40yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying 4homer spree sunday  both  of course  were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime  of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahns hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts  it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2scoreyear milestone  and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked   wish i was 40  and a topgrade big leaguer  the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days  but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history  yes  with bob grove  carl hubbell  herb pennock  art nehf  vernon gomez  et al  spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow  a ball players ball player  as they say in the trade  i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct 14  1951  before a new record crowd for the period of 18792   spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions   remarked enos slaughter  another allout guy  who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse  the spectacular mays  who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25  joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings  incidentally  only two did it before a home audience  bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field  ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies  the braves joe adcock  lou gehrig of the yankees  pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito  then with cleveland  made their history on the road  willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle  this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion  depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee  the record books  however  would favor the giants ace  in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases  once the figure was 3030  willies lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickeys  the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukees park  it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump  the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs  thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home  this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the games top rulers  the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the  living room athletic club  when games were cut off  actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy  this year  i am told  the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here  there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise  it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good  especially at the minor league level  you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy  this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game  cincinnati  ohio  ap   the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5game romp over outclassed cincinnati  crushing the reds in a humiliating 135 barrage monday in the loosely played finale  with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries  the american league champs still mounted a 15hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers  the most ever used by one team in a series game  johnny blanchard  mantles replacement  slammed a 2run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5run first inning  hector lopez  subbing for berra  smashed a 3run homer off bill henry during another 5run explosion in the fourth  the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors  the crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud  in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center  about 400 feet away  with two men on  momentarily the reds were back in the ball game  trailing only 63  but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out  in the fifth  wally post slashed a 2run homer off bud daley  but by that time the score was 115 and it really didnt matter  the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager  only bucky harris  the  boymanager  of washington in 1924  and eddie dyer of the st louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat  philadelphia  jan 23  nick skorich  the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles  was elevated today to head coach  skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between 20000 and 25000 a year  he succeeds buck shaw  who retired at the end of last season  the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff  jerry williams and charlie gauer  williams is a defensive coach  gauer works with the ends  choice was expected the selection had been expected  skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings  the newest national football league entry  van brocklin  the quarterback who led the eagles to the title  was signed by the vikings last wednesday  philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player  with skorich at the helm  the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running  rather than passing  in the past the club depended largely on van brocklins aerials  skorich  however  is a strong advocate of a balanced attack  split between running and passing  coach played 3 years skorich  who is 39 years old  played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers  an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season  he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949  he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy  n y  he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach  four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers  the eagles signed him for shaws staff in 1959  skorich began his new job auspiciously today  at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth  the eagles were honored for winning the championship  shaw and skorich headed a group of players  coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city

golfers association  will receive the ben hogan trophy for his comeback following a recent illness  the principal speaker will be senator stuart symington  democrat of missouri  golfs golden boy arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months  he won the masters  the united states open and a record 80738 in prize money  he was heralded as  sportsman of the year  by sports illustrated  and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the  professional athlete of the year   a distinction that earned for him the 10000 diamondstudded hickok belt  but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot  a couple of weeks ago  he scored a monstrous 12 on a par5 hole  it made him human  and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair  if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege  there was hope left for all  it was neither a spirit of selfsacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold  he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all  the worlds best golfer  shooting below par  came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher  he boomed a 280yard drive  then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance  no margin for error on the narrow fairway of a 508yard hole  arnold whipped into his second shot  the ball went off in a majestic arc  an outofbounds slice  he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds  he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side   it is possible that i overcorrected   he said ruefully  each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes  so he wound up with a dozen   it was a nice round figure  that 12   he said as he headed for the clubhouse  not too much perturbed  from the standpoint of the army of duffers  however  this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open  the idol of the hackers  of course  is ray ainsley  who achieved a 19 in the united states open  their secondary hero is another pro  willie chisholm  who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully  willies partner was long jim barnes  who tried to keep count  stickler for rules  how many is that  jim    asked willie at one stage of his excavation project   thirteen   said long jim   nae  man   said willie   ye must be countin the echoes   he had a 16  palmers dozen were honestly earned  nor were there any rules to save him  if there had been  he would have found a loophole  because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book  this knowledge has come in handy  too  his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway  the ball floated downstream  a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy  who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie  arnold sent for joe dey  the executive secretary of the golf association  joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream   i knew it all along   confessed arnold with a grin   but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there   for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity  palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings  yet he remains the fiercest of competitors  hell even bull headon into the rules when he is sure hes right  thats how he first won the masters in 1958  it happened on the twelfth hole  a 155yarder  arnolds iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green  an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains  thereby bringing local rules into force  ruling from on high  i can remove the ball  cant i    asked palmer of an official   no   said the official   you must play it where it lies    youre wrong   said arnold  a man who knows the rules   ill do as you say  but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling   he scored a 4 for the embedded ball  a 3 with the provisional one  the golfing fathers ruled in his favor  so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke  until a few weeks ago  however  arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers  but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys  a bigger hero than he ever had been before  a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today  other items on the agenda during the meetings  which are expected to continue through saturday  concern television  rules

end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand  moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment  after thursdays open date  solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night  harvey haddix  set back by the flu this season  will start against his former cardinal mates  who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonights game at busch stadium  boyer is suffering from a stiff neck  haddix has a 138 record against the redbirds  despite only a 13 mark in 1960  pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadnt decided between mizell and vern law for wednesdays game  mizell has won both of his starts  nieman kept in lineup  after a lengthy workout yesterday  an open date  hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup  that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record fivehome run day against the giants   i have to stay with nieman for a while   hemus said   bill white  sore ankles  should be ready  with a lefthander going for pittsburgh  i may use don taussig in center    lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes  and he looked good   hemus said   he should be getting back in the groove before long  our pitching is much better than it has shown   the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice  but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday  six bucks over  until the bucs bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend  the champions had eight men hitting over  despite the recession  pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages  smoky burgess  gino cimoli  bill virdon  bob clemente and dick groat  each  dick stuart  don hoak and bob skinner  bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet  perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend  who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs  friend is off to a great start with a 40 record but isnt likely to see action here this week   were getting friend some runs for a change  and he has been pitching good   murtaugh said   virdon has been blasting the ball  no plunkers for him   six bucs over  the pirates jumped off to an 113 start by may 1 last year  when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season  on last may 1  the cardinals stood at 76  ending a twoseason falloff on that milestone  in 1958  the birds were 310 on may 1  a year later they were 413  since 1949  the st louis club has been below on may 1 just four times  the 49 team was off to a soso 55 beginning  then fell as low as 1217 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories  the 52 cards were 67 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs  the clubs top since 1949  then last season the birds tumbled as low as 1118 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories  since 1949  the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the 55 dodger team  those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 212 mark and a ninegame lead by may 8  the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new yorks 51 giants  who dropped 11 of their first 13  they honored the battling billikens last night  speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who  in the words of coach john benington   had more confidence in themselves than i did   the most valuable player award was split three ways  among glen mankowski  gordon hartweger and tom kieffer  in addition  a special award was given to bob  bevo  nordmann  the 6foot10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury   you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing   benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies   but what this team had was a little different  the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability  they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do   several times i found the players pepping me up  where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk  wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say   dont worry  coach  well get em all right    the trio who shared the mostvaluable honors were introduced by bob broeg  sports editor of the postdispatch  kieffer  the only junior in the group  was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch  as well as his allround excellent play  mankowski  the ballhawking defensive expert  was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis us nationally televised victory  benington said   ive never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day   benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills  after the coach listed all the boys faults  hartweger said   coach before i leave here  youll get to like me   mrs benington admired gordons spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team  as hartweger accepted his silver bowl  he said   i want to thank coachs wife for talking him into letting me play   bob burnes  sports editor of the globedemocrat  presented bob nordmann with his award  bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time  within a week after the injury  suffered in st louiss victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament  nordmann was sitting on the bills bench doing what he could to help benington  on the clock given him was the inscription   for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball  196061   other lettermen from the team that compiled a 219 record and finished as runnerup in the national invitation tournament were  art hambric  donnell reid  bill nordmann  dave harris  dave luechtefeld and george latinovich   this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future   benington pointed out   by winning against bradley  kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts  they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesnt take a super team to do it   st louis university found a way to win a baseball game  larry scherer last night pitched a nohit game  said to be the first in billiken baseball history  as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college  51  at crystal city  the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie  the tie was against southeast missouri last friday  scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double  len boehmer also was 4for5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple  st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field  the game opened a busy week for washington  the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 330 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy  ill  saturday  happy hitting if its true that contented cows give more milk  why shouldnt happy ball players produce more base hits   the two top talents of the time  mickey mantle and willie mays  have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which  to be frank about it  never have quite reached expectations  and thats meant as a boost  not a knock  mays and mantle  both 10year men at 30  have so much ability that  baseball men agree  theyve never hit the heights  their heights  that is  mantle  the bullnecked blond switchhitter  had one sensational triplecrown season  1959  when he batted and also led the american league in home runs  52  and rbis  130  like the yankees slugger  mays  the terror of the giants  has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players  but not by  or for  willie  his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and 55 when he belted 51 home runs  drove in 127 and stole 24 bases  now  apparently happier under new managers  mays and mantle  the perfect players  are behaving as though theyre going to pass those previous peaks  labor relations yes  we know  theyre professionals  men paid to play  and they shouldnt care how theyre handled  just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month  the truth is  though  that men react differently to different treatment  for that matter  stan musial is rare  possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers  reserving his opinions  but not his effort  mantle  its apparent  resented casey stengels attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility  the old man was almost too possessive  stengel inherited dimaggio  rizzuto  but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors  from joplin to new york  with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him  ol case wanted no 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter  but also the best bunter  baserunner and outfielder  stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats  inheriting a more mature mantle  who now has seen the sights on and off broadway  ralph houk quietly bestowed  no pun intended  the mantle of authority on mickey  the major decided that  rather than be led  the slugger could lead  and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far  the opinion continues here that with a 162game schedule  pitching spread thin through a 10team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr  mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books  babe ruths 60 homers of 1927  four for alvin mays day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year  willies wonderful walloping sunday  four home runs  served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark  next to leo durocher  dark taught mays the most when he was a grassgreen rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month  to help the giants win a dramatic pennant  romantic news concerns

10 per cent through salary cuts and layoffs effective at 1201 am next saturday  the current monthly payroll comes to about 15000000  howard e simpson  the railroads president  said   a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action   the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b  o operates  salary cut and layoffs it will be accomplished in two ways  1 a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers  supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions  there are about 3325 officers and employees in this class  2 sufficient layoffs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense  since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract  it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough  a b  o spokesman said  those union members kept on their jobs  therefore  will not take a cut in their wages  the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the layoffs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job  a thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of 18 at franklin and mount streets  the victim  norman b wiley  38  of the 900 block north

superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what  the proposal was made by dr david s jenkins after he and mrs d ellwood williams  jr  a board member and longtime critic of the superintendent  argued for about fifteen minutes at this weeks meeting  the disagreement was over what dr jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting  cites discrepancies mrs williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr jenkinss conversation and how they were written up for the boards approval   i hate to have these things come up again and again   dr jenkins commented as he made his suggestion   these are the boards minutes  ill write what you tell me to   for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago  it was about that time  a board member said later  that dr thomas g pullen  jr  state superintendent of schools  told dr jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him  the board of county commissioners  the sanitary commission  the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings  dr jenkins notes  however  that most of the school boards in the state do not do so  state senator joseph a bertorelli  d  first baltimore  had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of west pratt street  he was taken to

complained yesterday that there are  deficiencies  in the citys snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible  councilman william d schaefer  d  fifth  said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month  werner criticized conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm  mr schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here  he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december  equipment should be in operation  almost immediately after the first snowfall   mr schaefer said  the councilman  who is the administration floor leader  also criticized bernard l werner  public works director  for  halting snow operations  on tuesday night after the sunday storm  sent home for rest mr werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week  what he did  mr werner said  was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest  work resumed wednesday  he said  mr schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan  under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them  should be  strictly enforced   admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority  the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas  not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive   recounting personal observations of clearance work  the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes  annapolis

new housing market enjoyed by apartments  which began about six years ago  has more than tripled within that span of time  in 1961  it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction  while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction  the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartmentbuilding field  although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments  leo j pantas  vice president of a hardware manufacturing company  pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common  a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house  convenience held key  convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today  troublefree  longlife

apartments in the cherry hill section  ultimately the development will comprise 300 units  in twostory and threestory structures  various of the apartments are of the terrace type  being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct  others  which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs  have balconies  the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction

soviet spy ring  secret service agents testified today  the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year  it is a killer sub  that is  a hunter of enemy subs  it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navys nautilus  the worlds first atomic submarine  its power unit  however  was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack  five held for trial the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st police court here at the end of a three day hearing  a full trial was ordered for  two british civil servants  miss ethel gee  46  and her newly devoted friend  harry houghton  55  and divorced  they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard  gordon a lonsdale  37  a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport  when arrested  he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as antisubmarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping  it was testified  flashed to moscow a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger  bookseller  and wife  joyce   in washington  the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen  an american couple formerly of new york city   in their suburban cottage the crown charges  the krogers received secrets from the mystery man  usually on the first saturday evening of each month  and spent much of the weekend getting the secrets off to moscow  either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books  each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing  a printed page  or a manuscript  all five pleaded innocent  only miss gee asked for bail  her young british lawyer  james dunlop  pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother  80  her maiden aunt  also 80 and bedridden for 20 years  and her uncle  76  who once ran a candy shop  refuses to grant bail  i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them   said the magistrate  kjp baraclough  the trial will be held  probably the first week of march  in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs  the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s  was sentenced to 14 years in prison  fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five  who may have altered history in the 1960s  fuchs  after nine and a half years  was released  being given time off for good behavior  he promptly went to communist east germany  the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five 29000

krogers were the bankers for moscow  lonsdale the red paymaster  and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their countrys secrets   of highest value  the fact that secrets of the dreadnought  and thereby of the american undersea fleet  were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier  but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navys chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare  capt george symonds  he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon  jan 7  the information  he said  would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy  court cleared just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring  watched for six months  was broken remained untold  the british defending lawyers  who today increased from three to four  demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury  the chances of their clients would improve  so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour  almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet  britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed  the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack  with the machinery went a complete design for the hull  the skipjack was a second generation

basic hull form  a teardrop  and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines  including the potent polaris missile submarines   the statement went on  the atom reactor  water cooled  was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp  thru development  the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size  and also in complexity  allowing a single propeller to be used  the navy said  the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work  it was first tried out on a conventional submarine  the albacore  in 1954  the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built  reputedly it could outrun  underwater  the fastest destroyers  it could  reputedly  go 70000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month  it was of the hunterkiller type  designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes  the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gees purse would  if completed and handed back  have given the kremlin a complete picture  of our current antisubmarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future   interested in detector the spy ring also was particularly interested in asdic  the underwater equipment for detecting

trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the states tax laws made such a step possible   emory universitys charter and bylaws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race   board chairman henry l bowden stated  but an official statement adopted by the 33man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes  the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law  taxexempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated   emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning  of true university grade  and meet its financial obligations  without the taxexemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions   the statement said  the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation  an emory spokesman indicated  however  that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws  the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if  among other criteria   all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people  and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people   at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies  but their taxexempt status never has been challenged by the state  emory is affiliated with the methodist church  some church leaders  both clerical and lay  have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation  urged in 1954 the student newspaper  the emory wheel  as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation   from its beginning   the trustees statement said friday   emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning  teaching  research and study  according to highest standards  under christian influence  are paramount in the emory university policy   as a private institution  supported by generous individuals  emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education   there is not now  nor has there ever been in emory universitys charter or bylaws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race  color or creed  insofar as its own governing documents are concerned  emory university could now consider applications from prospective students  and others seeking applications from prospective students  and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university  irrespective of race  color or creed  corporate existence  on the other hand  emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia   when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory taxexemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities  emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race  color or creed  continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education   a young man was killed and two others injured at midnight friday when the car

knowledge of such a letter  and that it was not in the friday mail  however  three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend  gather here the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday  several theater operators said  however  that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the threeday affair  student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago  charles a black  coahr chairman  said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct 31 but had failed to show up  he declined to name the three  fridays letters asked for a nov 15 meeting  failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend  the letters said  would be considered a  sign of indifference   black said coahr  hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action  but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal  a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that  extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and standins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits  besides managers of downtown theaters

multnomah  as of aug 22  had spent 58918 out of its budgeted 66000 in the category  leaving only 7082 for the rest of the month  at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month  this could mean a shortage of as high as 17000  but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month  smythe said  no request for emergency allotment had yet been

processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes  acting administrator andrew f juras said that because of fields unique position and knowledge in the program  the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period  but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles  and he said he personally  regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past   he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing   and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave   salary termed modest juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government  he also said that the salary  in terms

vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife  carl w buchheister  president of the national audubon society  said today   it is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8yearold and telling him to run out and play   he commented  buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target  the fire ant   but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop   he said  the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming  there have even been serious errors in the u s forest service  whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training  he added   the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who  forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents  are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries   buchheister told the delegates  in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying  buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill  creation of national seashore parks  including point reyes   preservation of the wetlands where birds breed   a pesticides coordination act   stronger water pollution control programs  and federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil  the reed rogers da fonta wild life sanctuary in marin county on friday officially became the property of

an  inviolate  sanctuary for all birds  animals and plants  seventeen years ago today  german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a v1 rocketbomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber  the world war 2  german bomber rolled down a runway and took off  the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip  this had never been done before  now a quietspoken  middleaged man  fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheeds missiles and space division at sunnyvale  where he played a key role in the development of the navys polaris missile  he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944   the first two pilots had crashed   he said   i had developed the machines and therefore knew them  it was time to go up myself   fiedler was then technical director of hitlers supersecret  reichenberg project   which remained unknown to the allies until after the war  about 200 of the special v1 rocketbombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead  the target was allied shipping  a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe  the success of the project depended upon fiedlers flight  squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rockets automatic guidance mechanism  the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude  at 12000 feet  fiedler signaled  release   and started the roaring pulsejet engine  then streaked away from beneath the heinkel  to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck  hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 mph  it was probably mans first successful flight in a missile   she flew beautifully   said fiedler   there was only one power control  a valve to adjust the fuel flow  i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip   using a steering system that controlled the modified rockets tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons  fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage  he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 mph  fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown  and banked into the airfield  moments later the v1 skimmed across the landing strip  edging closer and closer to a touchdown  then in a streamer of dust it landed  fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles  the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb  pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water  striking below the waterline of individual ships  a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers  but the project was halted before the end of the war  and the missiles later fell into allied hands  now a family man with three children  fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale  his spare time is spent in soaring gliders   its so quiet   he said   so slow  serene  and so challenging   john di massimo has been elected president of the 1961 columbus day celebration committee  it was announced yesterday  other officers are angelo j scampini

of the san francisco american friends service  a quaker organization  will march to san francisco for a rally in union square at 2 pm saturday  in a letter to the american friends service  dr schweitzer wrote   leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out   they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack  the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons   otherwise no peace is possible   governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger   therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency   a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein  47  who

persecution  it was announced today  probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue  which was sold to the public during the past week  for many reasons  the demand to buy shares in the dallasheadquartered company was tremendous  it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock   it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell  investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25  and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many  in fact  very few customers  anywhere in the nation  were able to get more than 100 shares  some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares  for all of their customers  a measure of how hot the stock was  can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began  the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of 1250 a share  the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler  guerin  turner  the managing underwriter  was at 17 a share  and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around 22 a share  but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market  indeed  from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january  the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up  letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation  all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold  185000 to the public at 1250  with another 5000 reserved for morton foods employes at 1150 a share   there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering   we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas  cable confirmation   it said translated  but egt could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares  after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone  but the result of it all was  egt partner dean guerin believes  an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation   i feel confident the stock will qualify for the  national list    he said  meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country  he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do  but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one   the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances  first  the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months  driving stocks of all kinds up  as a result  it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced  at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings  to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64cent anticipated dividend   second  the  potato chip industry  has caught the fancy of investors lately  and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks  frito and h w lay  on the market  both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months  both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at  and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup  and third  the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a  growth  industry in the public mind of late  foods  which long had been considered  recession resistant  but hardly dynamic stocks  have been acting like growth stocks  going to higher priceearnings ratios  the potato chip industry these days is growing  not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods  but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger  the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days  those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives  men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest  but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms  so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock  and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito  all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is  now  if mortons newest product  a corn chip known as chipos  turns out to sell as well as its stock did  the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to  dallas and north texas is known worldwide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies  valued in the millions of dollars  more than 10 companies maintain facilities in

administrations proposals  complex and sweeping as they are  all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core  stated caron s stallard  first vicepresident of the mortgage bankers association of america  santa barbara   the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn   beryl w sprinkel  economist of harris trust  savings bank  chicago  predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn  california group  conference  another speaker  william h draper  jr  former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper  gaither  anderson  urged the us to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we wont be pushed around any more   he urged support for president kennedys requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations   not flash in pan  sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern   in view of the current expansion  which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months  but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960   thesis refuted sprinkel strongly refuted the current neostagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth  declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence   rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 195960 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth   he said  it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery   danger cited he cautioned that  the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation   the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it  even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958   the unsatisfactory 195860 expansion  he said  was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike  sacrifices needed draper declared   as i see it  this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today  we must justify our heritage  we must be ready for any needed sacrifice   he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration  that  russia respects our show of strength  but that presently were not acting as we should and must   he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action  and noted that in war  you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do   while he declined to suggest  how  he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro   for unless we do were liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere  its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i dont believe we can permit that   new york  ap   stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery  erasing all of mondays losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks  analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hopedfor  support level  represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average  it was a

an 800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g peterson  head of one of the worlds greatest camera firms  in a key address before the american marketing assn  however  peterson  president of bell  howell  warned 800 us marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador  that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and  unconventional wisdom   creations needed  as we look to the 800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40 in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal  management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed   peterson said   with this kind of new product logjam  the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically   the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past  but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the shortterm advantage which it often needs  nothing to fear peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas  he cited  as an example  how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs  by improving its production knowhow and technology  he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an allautomatic camera in germany  with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market  election of howard l taylor to membership in pacific coast stock exchange  effective tuesday  has been announced

bankruptcy if the chesapeake  ohio and baltimore  ohio railroads merge  perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger  but could possibly be an ultimate effect  the railroad

things weaken us   perlman said  bad condition board chairman howard simpson of the baltimore  ohio railroad co  testified the b  o was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the chesapeake  ohio railroad   the financial situation of the baltimore  ohio  has become precarious  much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s   he told the hearing  c  o president walter j tuohy was summoned back for crossexamination by new york central attorneys before examiner john bradford who is hearing

do somewhat better than their fellow builders   elburn  ill  farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales   weve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more  we sold only four pickers all last year   gus ehlers  competitor of mr houtz in this farm community  says his business since august 1 is running 50 above a year earlier   before then  my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20   he says  though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business  farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas  paradoxically  the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output  although the administrations program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934  farmers  with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather  are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines  fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently  the higher price supports provided by the new legislation  together with rising prices for farm products  are pushing up farm income  making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery  seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10 above last year   in august our dealers sold 13 more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14 higher than last year   says mark v keeler  farm equipment vice president of international harvester co  for the year to date  sales of the companys farm equipment dealers still lag about 5 behind 1960  two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states  two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier  with the increases ranging from 5 to 50  not all sections are showing an upswing  however   the droughtseared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend  the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry  the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally  farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products  more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nations trucks  buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances  chemicals and other products  farmers are so eager for new machinery that theyre haggling less over prices than they did a year ago  dealers report   farmers arent as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale   says jack martin  who sells j i case tractors and implements in sioux city  iowa   this morning  we allowed a farmer 600 on the old picker he traded in on a new 2700 model  last year  we probably would have given him 700 for a comparable machine   mr martin sold 21 tractors in august   in august of 1960  he sold seven  dealers stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25 below a year ago  the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the countrys farm equipment manufacturers  for example  farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5 above a year earlier  mr keeler reports  tractor production at masseyferguson  ltd  of toronto in july and august rose to 2418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier  says john staiger  vice president  with the lower dealer inventories and the steppedup demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements  merritt d hill  ford motor co vice president  says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers  except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961  retail farm equipment sales have trailed yearearlier levels since the latter part of 1959  the rise in sales last winter was checked when the governments new feed grain program was adopted   the program resulted in a cutback of around 20 in planted acreage and  as a result  reduced the immediate need for machines  nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects  total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129 of the 194749 average  three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960  the government also is aiding farmers income prospects  agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers 14 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments  well above the record 11 billion of 1958 and about double the 639 million of 1960  price support loans may total another 1 billion this year  with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960  farmers gross income is estimated at 395 billion  15 billion above 1960s record high  net income may reach 127 billion  up 1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953  the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at midseptember for the third consecutive month  reaching 242 of the 191014 average compared with 237 at midjuly  kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling  the supreme court decision in mid1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined  the company  in figuring its taxable earnings  deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products  such  depletion allowances   in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets  the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground  not to the revenue from finished products  a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the rulings impact  on prioryear returns still under review  for claymining companies that make brick and tile products  the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50 of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone  president kennedy  in signing the relief measure into law  stressed he regarded it as an exception   my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries   the president said  charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the irs  the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date  purpose  amount and other particulars of the contribution  requests for substantiation  the service indicated  can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return  such as tickets to a show  in such an instance  revenuers stressed  the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received  a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested  a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax  under federal law  on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation  louisiana  however  collected an income tax on the profits from the sale  the corporation  in filing its final federal income return  claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense  as permitted under us tax law  the revenue service disallowed the claim  invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was taxexempt income  the tax court rejected this view  it said the taxfreedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations  the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a yearold irs ruling on the subject  the service has not said what its next step will be  peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency  it provides that the 1800 termination payment each cadet is to get  after serving a twoyear hitch without pay  will be spread

kicked back  to the companys advertising manager  the tax court ruled  the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager  the court upheld the taxpayers contention that these  kickbacks  were not his income though they passed through his hands  the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved  commenting   it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction   a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel  the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers excise tax on householdtype appliances  hiring the wife for ones company may win her taxaided retirement income  a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls  for example  may be entitled to distributions under the companys pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage  she would be taxed on the pensions when received  of course  but the companys contributions would be taxfree  a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement  experts warn  is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income  in that event  they note  the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law  possible upshots  the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments  or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made  state briefs  voters in four counties containing and bordering denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2 sales tax within that area  colorado

at cost to an oil company  by a whollyowned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent  the states occupation tax is computed on gross sales  the court held that the tax applied to nonprofit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities  washington  consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months  the government reported  the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under 18 billion in april  down 1 from the march level of more than 182 billion  april sales also were 5 below those of april last year  when volume reached a record for any month  189 billion  see chart on page one   the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year  two weeks earlier than in 1960  and preeaster buying was pushed into march  commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march  adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 25 from those of the month before  which in turn were slightly higher

with the thing as i am  is that 90 of the problem is transportation  i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until  at long last  both of my boys got squeezed into high school  it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school  getting to and from school was no problem  they either walked or were driven  now they go to a high school that is two miles away  one might think the problem would be similar  they could walk  ride on a bus or be driven  its much more complex than that  generally  they go to school with a girl named gloriana  who lives down the block  and has a car  this is a way of getting to school  but  i understand  it entails a certain loss of social status  a young man doesnt like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isnt even in a higher class than he is  and is also a girl   why dont you walk to school then    i suggested   my father walked  through two miles of snow  in illinois    did you    i was asked   no   i said   i didnt happen to grow up in illinois   i explained  however  that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom  i had to ride a streetcar two miles  sometimes the streetcar was late  sometimes there werent even any seats  i had to stand up  with the ladies  sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all  but wound up at the ocean  or some other dismal place  and had to spend the day there  ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then  when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car  she has to have at least one car herself  i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife  who is only a woman  even that isnt satisfactory  if they have to take any car  theyd rather take the big one  they say that when they take a car  gloriana doesnt take her car  but rides with them  but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her  so the little car isnt big enough  the logic of that is impeccable  of course  except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car  by my wife  when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself  the solution  naturally  is the bus  however  its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus  and its too hard on my legs  my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there  but thats hardly realistic  nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman  and hes already got an education  advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the

the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies  and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action  rather than put away in boxes  displayed as lamps  the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent  to create such a lamp  order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop  measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket  allowing three to four inches above the puppets head  make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted  l   the foot of the  l  about three inches long  so that the puppet can hang directly under the light  pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet  suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base  in this way  you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position  with feet  or one foot  barely resting on the pedestal  if the puppets are of uniform size  you can change them in accord with your childs whims  although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony  it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a childs playtime  those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merrygoround  the scalloped edge is particularly appealing  todays trend toward furniture designs from americas past is teaching homeowners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era  a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions  in the background lurked the feeling  however  that these pieces  beautiful as they were  lacked the utilitarian touch  so juniors bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy  nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the  hard knocks   while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only  this isnt true of the many homemakers of the 1960s  according to decorator consultant  leland alden  housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs  says mr alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had  an innate sense of the practical   solid investment there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop  down to earth  designs  or go out of business  hotel escapes bonanza room has a real

anything a frustrated individual can do about communisms growing threat on our doorstep and around the world   more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 pm sunday at first presbyterian church  at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged  a young real estate salesman  kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force  he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing  kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism  but never felt there was anything he  as an individual  could do about it  when he attended the christian anticommunist crusade school here about six months ago  jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it  the best approach  he figured  was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church  and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote  a biblically strong christianity  so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program  this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation   a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack  another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami   and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism

encourage other churches to try their own programs  kern said this sundays sessions  including the free dinner  will be open to anyone who makes reservations  the need for and the way to achieve a

leningrad kirov ballet  which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house  is  i think  the finest  classical  ballet company i have ever seen  and the production of the petipatschaikowsky  sleeping beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing  this work is no favorite of mine  i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar  infantile  and reactionary aspect   that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was   that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people   that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of selfplagiarisms  all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation  precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous  but most of them end in  ova    eva   or  aya   in other words  no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet  it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests  miss omsk  miss pinsk  miss stalingr oops  skip it  these qualities alone  however  would not account for their success  and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this companys collective personality  it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet  ohthepainofit  that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety  is totally absent from the kirov  this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics  but  obviously  at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned  irina kolpakova  the princess aurora of fridays performance  would be a change for the better anywhere  at any time  no matter who had had the role before  she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on  and her dancing has a feminine suavity  lightness  sparkle  and refinement which are simply incomparable  hit alla sizova  who seems to have made a special hit in the east  was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner  yuri soloviev  was wonderfully virile  acrobatic  and poetic all at the same time  in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky  vladilen semenov  a fine  danseur noble    konstantin shatilov  a great character dancer   and inna zubkovskaya  an excellent lilac fairy  were other outstanding members of the cast  but every member of the cast was magnificent  the production  designed by simon virsaladze  was completely traditional but traditional in the right way  it was done with great taste  was big and spacious  sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes  but sumptuous in a muted  pastellike style  with rich  quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery  evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra  one containing excellent soloists  the violin solos by the concertmaster  guy lumia  were especially fine  but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity  mail orders are now being received for the

the worlds greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests   for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television  so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies  after all  this years movies are next years television shows  so i went to see  la dolce vita   it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality  all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film  if thats all the romans did  its a surprise to me that rome fell  after television   la dolce vita  seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night  i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week  i believe tv watchers will be bored   la dolce vita  has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western  week in  week out  there is more sex to be seen in  the adventures of ozzie and harriet   there is more decadence on  77 sunset strip   there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any privateeye series  in another respect  television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns  with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg  the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater  most of the emphasis has been placed on a  wild party  at a seaside villa  producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties   the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease  carried as far as a black slip    a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face   a frigid beauty  and three silly fairies  put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of  dull  apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall  what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining   as a moral shocker it is a dud  but this doesnt detract from its merit as an interesting  if not great  film  the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly   this is a long picture and a

designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u s presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings  the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansions library  the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800s  the gift is being presented by  heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey  whose famous estate   tranquility   was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover  n j  authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon  although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago  this acquisition is a matched  perfect set  consisting of two sofas six feet long  plus six sidechairs and two armchairs  the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedys fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home  it is the aids intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of americana  before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall  the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture  the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem  mass  an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792  the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace  it will be painted to match the paneling in the room  the aid committees chairman in charge of the redecoration  mrs henry francis lenygon  was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project  mrs lenygons committee associates  announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york  include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel  both wellknown manhattan decorators  regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e barnes of boston  president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the 75minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard  n c  but he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music  at 4 pm the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians  students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp  and to greet the 325 crippled  cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert  it was the first in the series of  concerts for young people by young people  to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house  she was not present yesterday  however  to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience  she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port  mass  and in his welcoming remarks  the president said he was representing her  as he approached the open bandstand  erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion  the band struck up the  star spangled banner  and followed it with  hail to the chief    i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band  and we are grateful to them   president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl  after paying tribute to the conductor and his whiteclad youthful students  president kennedy said   as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states  schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music   he added  i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field   displaying his knowledge of music  the new englandborn president remarked that  probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont  by young americans  and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers  and their work is being duplicated all across the united states   this is a great national cultural asset  and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me  representing as i do today my wife  to welcome all of you here today at the white house   as he left the bandstand to return to his office  the slender  suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests  he expressed surprise to learn that pretty  blonde patricia holbrook  16  of mount rainier  had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston   the nuns there do a wonderful work   the president commented  patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district  each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red  white and blue ribbon  they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff  many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience  and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected  henry hall wilson  a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the presidents staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives  turned guest conductor for a sousa march  the  stars and stripes forever   transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary  letitia baldrige  told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring  he said he contacted a friend  henry hall wilson  on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play  in the series  a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85student north carolina group to play the first concert  one of the most interested  students  on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house  was letitia baldrige  social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy   i was an art major in college   miss baldrige explained   ive been here so many times i couldnt count them   she turned out to be a fan  too  of margaret bouton  the gallerys associate curator of education  miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 pm  the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 pm  remaining for about 45 minutes  the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later  they decided that they thought rembrandts selfportrait made him look  sad    they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphaels  alba madonna  and  texture  in a monet painting of rheims cathedral  everybody had heard of van gogh  the french impressionist  gallery director john walker greeted the group  standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them  he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery  is the only museum in the country to have a fulltime music director  richard bales  im sure youve heard of him and his record   the confederacy    along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group  went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards  in 45 minutes  the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century  a few of them said they  preferred contemporary art   among the other artists  whose paintings were discussed were boucher  courbet  fra angelico  the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallerys rotunda fountain  because its on the second floor   that imposing  somewhat austere  and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st nw took on bustling life yesterday  more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their

the late leader eulogized  c wheeler barnes of denver  head of the scottish rite in colorado  praised pike as a historian  author  poet  journalist  lawyer  jurist  soldier and musician  who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order  the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple  a reception and tea followed  about

fund  anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday  park rangers said  and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze  for crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev  mr kennedy replied   im hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground   the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable  but he was convinced that the realities of power  military  economic and ideological  were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting  he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy  last friday the white house announced  president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4  the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in eastwest relations  the heightened tension  in fact  had been a major factor in the presidents change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader  he was not going to vienna to negotiate  the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned  but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe  that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting  despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting  it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war  road to vienna the u s and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace  at the summit of the nations   the first time was in 1955 when a fulldress big four summit meeting produced the  spirit of geneva   the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east  in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s  that meeting produced the  spirit of camp david   a spirit  it later turned out  that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement  on the third occasion  another big four summit session at paris a year ago  there was no problem of an illusory  spirit   premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s for the u2 incident  the episode tended to confirm the u s belief that propaganda  the hope of onesided concessions  and the chance to split the allies  rather than genuine negotiation  were the soviet leaders real aims in summitry  preinaugural position thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president  mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem  shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words   as long as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way  no amount of either smiles or toughness  neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates  can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations   the president had set for himself the task  which he believed vital  of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance  he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary  he wanted time  too  to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating  above all  he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchevs doorstep  attitude flexible at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader  ideally  he knew  it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels  but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting  provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it  it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war  to try to probe mr khrushchevs intentions and to make clear his own views  moreover  an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions  both elements  the caution about a meeting  the willingness eventually to hold one  were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia late in february  the letter  dated feb 22  was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk  siberia  on march 9  it dealt mainly with a broad range of eastwest issues  but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted  developments over the next two months  however  caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing  there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting  not because the international climate was improving  but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly  deadlock on tests the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva  the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman  east  west and neutral  directorate  and thus a veto  over the control machinery  in the u s  strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing  mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown  or even continued stalemate  would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament  there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons  particularly to communist china  the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent  moreover  moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies  including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos  mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements  or even negotiations  impossible  developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting  initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting  at the same time  there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader  as a result of those episodes  come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the wests ability and determination to resist communist pressure  in cuba  the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep  in laos  the picture was almost equally bad  u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be  neutralized  on soviet terms  beyond that  allied disagreement about military intervention in laos  despite warnings that they might do so  allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces  as a result  the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos  and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure  in the light of those events  there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself  ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive  he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out  the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin  iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back  it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future  mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies  the response from london  paris and bonn was favorable  firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week  apparently at the insistence of the u s  the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the  informal  nature of the meeting  the washington announcement said   the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries  the meeting will  however  afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries   the outlook the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned  67yearold veteran of the cold war who  in mr kennedys own words  is  shrewd  tough  vigorous  wellinformed and confident   and a 44yearold president  his birthday is may 29  with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy  the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval and disapproval  the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna  the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations  but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary  mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men  the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause  apart from the personal equation  another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit  premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway  this time the initiative came  in part at least  from washington  other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev  the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders  thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity  finally  there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord  there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world  if tests are to be resumed  the argument went  it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union  disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse  after cuba and laos  it was argued  mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness  perhaps even panic  and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds  moreover  the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments  the question was raised  for example  as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east  there are  so my biologist friends tell me  mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory  mollusks are a case in point  the shell  which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme  tended to cancel out the possibility of future development  though this may or may not be good biology  it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education  there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive  our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities  the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades  rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that  by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence  there is  however  one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture  viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect  we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university  but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project   certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy  official encouragement is one thing  but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds  american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning  they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made  diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility  all of this may be understandable enough  it is  however  in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise  yet for better or for worse  the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative  resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities  community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible  to understand the past history  and the future potential  of american catholic higher education  it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community  it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment  a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere  the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension  the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship  the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship  american catholic colleges and universities are  in a very real sense  the product of  private enterprise   the  private enterprise  of religious communities  had it not been for such private enterprise  diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees  there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility  the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the  family business   this  familycommunity  spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement  it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education  in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas  i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments  clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university  which is also coeducational  this is not an isolated example   this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough  it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot  apart  however  from the question of wasteful duplication  there is another aspect of the  family business  spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny  for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions  which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools  it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its  pursuit of excellence   at the earlier  preacademic excellence  stage of catholic education  the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis  but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training  the need for  outsiders  becomes more pressing  the problem is not merely that more  outside teachers  are needed but that a different brand is called for  commenting on the earlier stage  the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors  in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking  noted that the term  teacheremployee   as opposed to  eg   maintenance employee   was a not inapt description  today however  the  outsider  is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order  otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him  and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university  and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene  the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement  in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors  the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it   even with the best of intentions he  the president of the university  is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which  considered  as it must be by him  in individual terms  is inhomogeneous  mortal and of extremely varying temperament  interests and capabilities  it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are  in their opinion  identified with its highest good and  to use that oftrepeated phrase   the attainment of excellence    the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame  it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by  the organization which actually owns  it  becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished  outside  faculty  it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to  the organization which actually owns the university   this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension  but in any case  one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one   outside  faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business  there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university  in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel  word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession  much given to attending meetings and conferences  expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype  in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott  all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere  to appreciate the nature of the gamble  it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security  that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service  much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure  this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated  when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion  not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services  a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the  family   just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices  it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions  adequate compensation is indispensable  yet adequate compensation  and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place  broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university  religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification  there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that  at the college level  the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels  the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication  even informal debates over the luncheon table  are a contribution to the total good of the institution  but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation  the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the  ingroup  that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees  is  therefore  the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself  this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure  yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control  there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order  the first is a negative warning  there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority  in the case of academic personnel the  feeling  of participation can hardly be  faked   competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions  those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by  busywork  and ersatz decision making  in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all  in the notre dame report  reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to  luncheontable communication   in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of  participation   the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy  ie  members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution  have their own eating arrangements  sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws  once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws  there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions  the law must treat everybody equally  or  in the words of anatole france   the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich  as well as the poor  from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges   the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellans hearings into corruption in labormanagement relations and  later  into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites  the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program  in addition  disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill  it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages  but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike  business week  aug 9  1961  reports that the united aircraft company  against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike  decided to keep its plants operating  the company incurred some 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors  advertising to attract new employees  hiring and training them  extra overtime  and defective work performed by the new workers  the company has billed the united states government for 7500000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractors business  rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee  the committee remains unresponsive  neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter   they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the antimonopoly laws to the unions  the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the antitrust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained  the antitrust laws inform a business that it must compete  but along completely undefined lines   it must play a game in which there never is a winner  the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law  hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy  let us look at the heavyelectricalgoods industry in which general electric  westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market  the industry is so structured that pricesetting by a multiproduct company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated  whether marginal or average pricing is applied  the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment  accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price  naturally  enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time  should these giants really flex their competitive muscles  they would become the only survivors in the industry  uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by  unfair competition   but if they show selfrestraint  they dont get the orders  under the circumstances  the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted  engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants  the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government  after the conviction  that general electric sign a wideopen consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows  in other words  the antitrust laws  designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday  wednesday and friday  become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday  thursday and saturday  and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday   the question might be asked   dont the managements of the heavyelectricalgoods manufacturers know these facts   why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas  throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter  expressing their complete confidence in the laws    the past usefulness of the antitrust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold  in the folklore of capitalism  back in 1937  he wrote    p 211  the antitrust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations  and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure   p 214  antitrust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship   p 215  when corporate abuses were attacked  it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control  in this manner  every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the antitrust laws   pp 228229  in any event  it is obvious that the antitrust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known  held together by some of the most fantastic ideas  all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government   this escape from control has led to managements evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while  a plea of nolo contendere  followed by a nominal fine  after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license   the penalties handed out in the electrical case  which included jail sentences  were unprecedented in antitrust prosecutions  perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities   if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market  quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest  a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle  however  one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the antitrust laws are effective and rational  quite clearly the antitrust laws are neither effective nor rational  and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union  those who favor placing trade unions under antitrust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform  before 1933  individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english  the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934  implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act  has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle  the wagner act  the tafthartley act and the landrumgriffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining  the basic purpose of an effective collectivebargaining system is the removal of wages from competition  if a union cannot perform this function  then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud  the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession  the problem must be faced squarely  if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn  unsupported  by the way  by any agricultural subsidy   then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them  human labor was exactly that  a commodity  in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury america  as early as 1776  adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations   we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work   but many against combining to raise it   eighteenthcentury england  upon whose customs our common law was built  had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies  in 1825  the boston house carpenters strike for a tenhour day was denounced by the organized employers  who declared   it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies   there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining  but against labor monopoly  the courts shared the opinion of the employers  in people vs fisher  justice savage of the new york supreme court declared   without any officious and improper interference on the subject  the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it   but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means   compare this statement of a nineteenthcentury judge with how congressman martin  according to the daily labor report of sept 19  1961  defends the necessity of enacting antitrust legislation in the field of labor  if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages  production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages  hours and conditions of employment   senator mcclellan is proposing the application of antitrust measures to unions in transportation  his bill  allegedly aimed at hoffa  would amend the sherman  clayton and norrislaguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union  even a sister local in the same international  paradoxically  the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the antitrust act to labor in transportation  the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel  the action would not be deemed a violation of the antitrust act  indeed  it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the antitrust laws   for example  the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers  at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of antitrust legislation  a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the antimonopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates  the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies  it was most effective against trade unions  in the famous danbury hatters case  a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices  eg  trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer  the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment  in 1914  the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the antitrust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity  the law could not suspend economics  labor remained a commodity  but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the antitrust laws  the courts  by interpretation  emasculated the act  in 1922  the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company  the company sued under the antitrust laws  alleging that the unions activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce   what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise    the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce  the nation the threefront war at a closeddoor session on capitol hill last week  secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on us affairs abroad  afterward  tennessees democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen  what herter presented  said gore  was  not a very encouraging review   that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts  while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos  two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions  1  cuba  hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery  dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and drastic demand  within 48 hours  the us had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons  the embassy staff alone totaled 87 us citizens  plus 120 cuban employees   president eisenhower held an 830 am meeting with top military and foreignpolicy advisers  decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately   there is a limit to what the united states in selfrespect can endure   said the president   that limit has now been reached   through secretary herter  ike offered presidentelect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision  kennedy  through secretarydesignate of state dean rusk  declined  he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan 20  although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the us and latin america  see the hemisphere   2  laos  after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants  the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the prowestern government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam   in view of the present situation in laos   said the pentagons announcement   we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific   cutting short a holiday at hong kong  the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea  accompanied by a swarm of destroyers  plus troopships loaded with marines  on the uss island base of okinawa  task force 116  made up of army  navy  marine and air force units  got braced to move southward on signal  but by weeks end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration  see foreign news   and the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist  rather than a prowestern  government might be best for laos  french  indians  there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other coldwar fronts  political  economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic  mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war  and they were probably right   it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again   said one military man  but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground   at geneva in 1954  to get the war in indochina settled  the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state  north viet nam  which then  predictably  became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos  the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement  saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west  he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj   the important thing from now on   he said   is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia   russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana  russian intrigue in the congo  and russian arms drops in laos  using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo  made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time  soviet premier khrushchev sent new years hopes for peace to presidentelect kennedy  and got a cool acknowledgment in reply  considering the state of the whole world  the cold wars three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous   but  in senator gores words  it was  not a very encouraging  situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day  the congress turmoil in the house as the 87th congress began its sessions last week  liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor  the liberal pressure bloc  which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group  had fought the committee before  and had always lost  this time  they were much better prepared and organized  and the political climate was favorable  they had the unspoken support of presidentelect kennedy  whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck  and counting noses  they seemed to have the votes to work their will  deadly deadlock  there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee  1  to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservativeliberal deadlock  or 2  to remove one of the conservatives  namely mississippis 14term william meyers colmer  pronounced calmer   caucusing  the liberals decided to go after colmer  which actually was the more drastic course  since seniority in the house is next to godliness  a dour  gangling man with a choppy gait  colmer looks younger than his 70 years  has gradually swung from a moderate  internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative  he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project  unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents  he is  of course  a segregationist  but he says he has never made an  antinegro  speech  for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee  there his vote  along with those of chairman howard smith  the courtly virginia judge  and the four republican members  could and often did produce a 66 deadlock that blocked farout  democraticsponsored welfare legislation  a tactic often acceptable to the rayburnjohnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes   equal treatment  there was sufficient pretext to demand colmers ouster  he had given his lukewarm support to the antikennedy electors in mississippi  reprisals are not unheard of in such situations  but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons  in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman  and in 1957  after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956  his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments  although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage   in the heat of the anticolmer drive last week  judge smith threatened reprisal against powell  said he   we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here    but speaker sam rayburn  after huddling in palm beach with presidentelect kennedy  decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee  and that he was the only man who could do anything effective  in a tense  closeddoor session with judge smith  rayburn attempted to work out a compromise  to add three new members to the rules committee  two democrats  including one southerner  and one republican   smith flatly rejected the offer  and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels  the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news  he would lead the fight to oust colmer  whom he is said to regard as  an inferior man   news of rayburns commitment soon leaked out  when missouris clarence cannon got the word  he turned purple   unconscionable    he shouted  and rushed off to the speakers room to object   a dangerous precedent    cannon  a powerful  conservative man  brought welcome support to the smithcolmer forces  as chairman of the appropriations committee  he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal porkbarrel projects  sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally  georgias carl vinson  chairman of the armed services committee  threat of war  as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses  it became clear that judge smith could lose  his highest count of supporters numbered 72  and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260member democratic caucus  the liberals  smelling blood  were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes  in the democratic committee on committees  in the full party caucus  and on the floor of the house  before they could oust colmer   one big question  if colmer was to be purged  what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors    in all three arenas  they seemed certain of victory  especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash  but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war  if the southerners were sufficiently aroused  they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships  leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated  unworkable party  with that possibility in mind  arkansas wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees  and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of facesaving compromise   here are two old men  mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone   said a house democratic leader   one wants a little more power  and the other doesnt want to give up any   battle in the senate the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberalconservative battle  but in contrast with the houses guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guides speech  question at issue  how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate  and thereby cut off legislationdelaying filibusters   a wideranging  bipartisan force  from minnesotas democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall  was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats  who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills  new mexicos clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senates notorious rule 22 to allow threefifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate  instead of the current hardtoget twothirds  fair dealer humphrey upped the ante  asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators  georgias dick russell objected politely  and the battle was joined  privately  the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage  privately  they also admitted that their hopes for clint andersons threefifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon  in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress  and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding  armed with the nixon opinion  the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week  hopefully  the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all  republicans last act since election day  vice president richard nixon had virtually retired  by his own wish  from public view  but with the convening of the new congress  he was the public man again  presiding over the senate until john kennedys inauguration  one day last week  nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote  and then to make  sufficient declaration  of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election  nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace  then went beyond the required  sufficient declaration    this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated   he said  the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves  gary player  the small  trim south african  was the eventual winner  but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap  arnold palmer  the defending champion  lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief   just when you think you have it licked  this golf course can get up and bite you   player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament  and that is just what happened on the last few holes  the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer  player was the first to feel its teeth  after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34  two strokes under par  on this fifth and final day of the tournament  sundays fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed   players game rapidly fell to pieces  he bogeyed the 10th  after a journey through woods and stream he doublebogeyed the 13th  he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2overpar 74 and a 72hole total of 280  as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course  player was almost in tears  he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer  by then playing the 15th hole  was leading him by a stroke  palmer had started the round four strokes behind player  and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes  now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf  when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole  he seemed to have the championship won  but the seveniron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression  in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green  past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower  afterwards  palmer told charlie coe  his lastround partner  that he simply played the hole too fast  he did seem hasty on his second and third shots  but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out  giving palmer a chance to recover his composure  which he had quite visibly lost  when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot  he overshot the hole by 15 feet  palmer was now putting merely for a tie  and player  who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment  stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt  palmers 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro  but it was barely good enough for a secondplace tie with coe  the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur  who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years  refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69  end at seven until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters  four last year and three this  without ever being out of first place  as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing oneoverpar 73  this remarkable record was still intact  thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69  his threeround total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score  a 213 by bill collins  the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long  but palmer knew  as did everybody else at augusta  that his streak was about to be broken  half an hour after he finished his round  player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a threeround total of 206  four strokes ahead of palmer  more than a streak had ended  long after the erratic climate and the washedout final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes  the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player  unlike most such sports rivalries  it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously  although this was not exactly the case  when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmers towering prestige  as if to confirm his stature  he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments  player won only one  but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago  player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars  and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere  on the final round at pensacola  the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and  although it was far from obvious at the time  the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come  on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and  as it turned out  neither won it  but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour  player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer  he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmers 71  thereafter  until the masters  player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami  when they reached augusta last week  together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date  instant rivalry on thursday  the first day of the masters  the contest between palmer and player developed instantly  it was a dismal  drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course  the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft  so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flagstick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences  palmers 4underpar 68 got him off to an early lead  which he shared with bob rosburg  but player was only one stroke back  with a 69  even so  it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators  unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever  that this tournament was to be  essentially  a match between palmer and player  a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus  the spectacular young amateur  who had a 70   or ken venturi  who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better   or rosburg  whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augustas treacheries   or even old byron nelson  whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf   on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe   on friday  a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly  the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus  rosburg had started early in the day  and by the time palmer and player were on the course  separated  as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend  by about half an hour  they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg  who ended with a 73  was not having a good day  as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman  his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender  player began with a birdie on the first hole  added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th  on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament  he birdied the 13th  the 15th and the 18th  five birdies  one bogey and 12 pars for a 68  starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle  palmer birdied the 2nd  the 9th  the 13th and the 16th  four birdies  one bogey and 13 pars for a 69  the roar of palmers gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta  only to be answered moments later by the roar of players gallery for a similar triumph  at one point late in the day  when palmer was lining up a 25foot putt on the 16th  a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole  without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed  although he later admitted that he had  palmer proceeded to sink his 25footer  and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply  the boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course  it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence  the bad luck that can so often mar a wellplayed round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions  bob jones played that way  byron nelson did  hogan did  and last week at the masters palmer and player did  as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest  it was players superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead  this day palmer had started first  as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day  player immediately proceeded to follow suit  in fact  he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well  to go 4 under par for the first eight holes  but players real test came on the ninth hole  a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards  he hit a poor tee shot  pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways  having hit one of the trees  the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out  player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5  or gambling  the latter involved hitting a full fourwood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse  hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green   i was hitting the ball well   player said later   and i felt strong  when youre playing like that youd better attack   player attacked with his fourwood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget  it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge  from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4  palmer  meanwhile  had been having his troubles  they started on the 4th hole  a 220yard par3  on this day the wind had switched 180degrees from the northwest to the southeast  and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days  at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a oneiron when a threewood was the proper club  so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green  his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par  starting the second nine  palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it  when mickey charles mantle  the new york yankees man of muscle  drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers  his feat touches upon the sublime  when roger eugene maris  mantles muscular teammate  powers four home runs in a doubleheader  his performance merits awe  but when tiny  145pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels  who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because  as a teammate explained   the other team thought no one was out there   hits seven home runs in four months  three more than his total in 1958  1959  and 1960   his achievement borders on the ridiculous  this is baseball 1961  this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous  it is the year when  1  amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and  in unprecedented style  delivered consecutive grandslam home runs    2  willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammates bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game    3  the milwaukee braves tied a majorleague record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them   and  4  catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat  two of them as a pinchhitter  pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats  the shrinking strike zone  and the fact that the knockdown pitch is now illegal  experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion  whatever the reasons  not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records  homerun division  of all the records in peril  one stands apart  dramatic in its making  dramatic in its endurance  and now  doubly dramatic in its jeopardy  this  of course  is baseballs most remarkable mark  the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure  the incredible athlete  george herman  babe  ruth of the yankees  since 1927  fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruths record and each  in turn  has been thwarted  what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruths amazing september surge  in the final month of the 1927 season  he hit seventeen home runs  a closing spurt never matched  double threat  always  in the abortive attacks upon ruths record  one man alone  a jimmy foxx  58 in 1932  or a hank greenberg  58 in 1938  or a hack wilson  56 in 1930   made the bid  but now  for the first time since lou gehrig  with 47 home runs  spurred ruth on in 1927  two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60  their names are mantle and maris  their team is the yankees  and their threat is real  after 108 games in 1927  ruth had 35 home runs  after 108 games in 1961  mickey mantle has 43  roger maris 41  extend mantles and mariss present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games  and  mathematically  each will hit more than 60 home runs  this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them  to better ruths mark  neither needs a spectacular september flourish  all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september  and he will establish a new record  in ruths day  and until this year  the schedule was 154 games  baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruths record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games    even on the basis of 154 games  this is the ideal situation   insists hank greenberg  now vicepresident of the chicago white sox   it has to be easier with two of them  how can you walk maris to get to mantle    roommates  neither mantle nor maris  understandably  will predict 60 home runs for himself  although both concede they would like to hit 60  they stick primarily to the baseball players standard quote   the important thing is to win the pennant   but one thing is for certain  there is no dissension between mantle  the american leagues most valuable player in 1956 and 1957  and maris  the mvp in 1960  each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs   i hope roger hits 80   mantle says   and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs   and i hope i hit 81    the sluggers get along so well in fact  that with their families at home for the summer  mantles in dallas  mariss in kansas city   they are rooming together  mantle  maris  and bob cerv  a utility outfielder  share an apartment in jamaica  long island  not far from new york international airport  the three pay 251 a month for four rooms  kitchen  dining room  living room  and bedroom   with airconditioning and new modern furniture  mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom   maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room  they divide up the household chores  cerv does most of the cooking  breakfast and sandwich snacks  with dinner out   mantle supplies the transportation  a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible   and maris drives the 25minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium  mantle  maris  and cerv probably share one majorleague record already  among them  they have fifteen children  eight for cerv  four for mantle  and three for maris  as roommates  teammates  and homerun mates  mantle  29  who broke in with the yankees ten years ago  and maris  26  who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago  have strikingly similar backgrounds  both were scholastic stars in football  basketball  and baseball  mantle in commerce  okla  maris in fargo  nd    as halfbacks  both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma   sometimes in the minors   maris recalls   i wished i had gone to oklahoma    to an extent  the two even look alike  both have blue eyes and short blond hair  both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds  but mantle  incredibly muscular  he has a 1712inch neck   looks bigger  with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders  both must have their clothes made to order  maris purchases 100 suits from simpsons in new york  mantle  more concerned with dress  buys his suits four at a time at neimanmarcus in dallas and pays as much as 250 each  light reading  neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual  but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus  henry millers  tropic of cancer   mantle so appreciated millers delicate literary style that he broadened teammates minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips  mantle is not normally given to public speaking  or  for that matter  to private speaking   what do you and mickey talk about at home    a reporter asked maris recently   to tell you the truth   maris said   mickey dont talk much   this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer  what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris  under constant pressure from writers and photographers  are trying to be cooperative  of the two  mantle is by nature the less outgoing  maris the more outspoken  but last week  when a reporter was standing near mantles locker  mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote   see that kid    he said  pointing to a darkhaired 11yearold boy   thats  yogi  berras  ill never forget one time i struck out three times  dropped a fly ball  and we lost the game  i came back  sitting by my locker  feeling real low  and the kid walks over to me  looks up  and says   you stunk    maris  in talking to reporters  tries to answer all questions candidly and fully  but on rare occasions  he shuns newsmen   when ive made a dumb play   he says   i dont want to talk to anyone  im angry   by his own confession  maris is an angry young man  benched at tulsa in 1955  he told manager dutch meyer   i cant play for you  send me where i can play    meyer sent him to reading  pa   benched at indianapolis in 1956  he told manager kerby farrell   im not learning anything on the bench  play me    farrell did  and maris led the team to victory in the little world series    thats the way i am   he says   i tell people what i think  if youre a good ballplayer  youve got to get mad  give me a team of nine angry men and ill give you a team of nine gentlemen and well beat you nine out of ten times   idols idols  one good indication of the two mens personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes  mariss was ted williams   when i was a kid   maris told a sportswriter last week   i used to follow williams every day in the box score  just to see whether he got a hit or not    when you came up to the majors  did you seek out williams for advice     are you kidding    said maris   youre afraid to talk to a guy you idolize   mantles hero was joe dimaggio   when mickey went to the yankees   says mark freeman  an exyankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver   dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker  just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man  this hero of his  but dimaggio never said a word  it crushed mickey  he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star  this never would be said of him   mantle has kept the vow  among all the yankees  he is the veteran most friendly to rookies  neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else  if laying ties on a railroad track  which he once did for 1 an hour  paid more than playing right field for the yankees  maris would lay ties on a railroad track  if working in a zinc mine  which he once did for 8712 cents an hour  paid more than playing center field for the yankees  mantle would work in a zinc mine  but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts  mantle and maris concentrate on baseball  they try to play baseball the best they can  each is a complete ballplayer  mantle  beyond any question  can do more things well    one of the reasons they get along fine   says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men   is that both realize mantle is headandshoulders above maris    hitting  mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both lefthanded and righthanded  maris only lefthanded  they both possess near classic stances  dug in firmly  arms high  set for fierce swings  mantle is considerably better hitting for average   fourth in the league  to for maris so far this year   both are good bunters  maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues   mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base  both have brilliant speed  mantle was timed from home plate  batting lefthanded  to first base in 31 seconds  faster than any other major leaguer   maris ran the 100yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against luis aparicio  the swift  basestealing shortstop of the white sox  both are good  daring fielders  mantle covers more ground   mariss throwing arm is stronger  yet with all their skills  the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic  the home run  with this ultimate weapon  the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season   american league expansion created  inevitably  weaker teams  only two teams in each league  the yankees and detroit  the dodgers and cincinnati  are battling for first place  appropriately  the emphasis on the home run  at a peak this year  came into being at baseballs lowest moment  in 1920  as the startling news

doormen in europes best hotels  but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh  there the name vaguely connotes newrich wealth  a reputation for eccentricity  and an ardor for collecting art  last week  in the german city of dusseldorf  g david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause  on display were 343 firstclass paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection  and every single one of them was up for sale  like philadelphias late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public  time  jan 2   thompson  at 61  is something of a legend in his own lifetime  he made his fortune during world war 2  when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom  even before he hit big money  he had begun buying modern paintings  he gave the impression of never having read a word about art  but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best  he was able to smell a bargain  and a masterpiece  a continent away  and the museum of modern arts alfred barr said of him   i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didnt know about   he might barge into a gallery  start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting  he could be lavishly generous with friends  cab drivers and bellboys  but with dealers he was tough  he bought up cezannes  braques  matisses  legers  a splendid picasso series  more than 70 giacometti sculptures  he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world  all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stones throw  outside pittsburgh  and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them  two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city  but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum  pittsburgh turned him down  just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years  he went then to a 40yearold basel art dealer named ernst beyeler  with whom he had long been trading pictures  last year beyeler arranged to sell 1500000 worth of klees to the state of north rhinewestphalia  which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built  last week most of the other prizes  once offered to pittsburgh  went on the block  at the opening of the dusseldorf show  thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time  in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them  some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town  thompson himself said   i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures   break in georgia the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color  but in all its 175 years  not a single negro student has entered its classrooms  last week federal district judge william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a  qualified  negro boy and girl  their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education  from kindergarten through graduate school  in georgia  and in alabama  mississippi and south carolina as well  for 18 months  hamilton holmes  19  and charlayne hunter  18  had tried to get into the university  they graduated together from atlantas turner high school  where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third  the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts  but was careful never to mention the color of their skins  holmes went to atlantas morehouse  negro  college  where he is a b student and star halfback  charlayne studied journalism at detroits wayne state university  last fall  after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court  judge bootle ordered them to apply again  charlayne was  tentatively  admitted for next fall  after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state  but holmes was rejected again  on the basis of his record and interview   the evidence in court was testimony about the interview  which for holmes lasted an hour  although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation  holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution  or a  beatnik parlor or teahouse   no  said he  but officials still called him  evasive   they also said he lied in saying that he had never been  arrested   their reason  holmes once paid a 20 speeding fine  had his license suspended  negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students  found that many were hardly interviewed at all  and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes  the real reason for his rejection  they argued  is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school  judge bootles

james b conant were consulted  two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors  including adlai stevenson  richard nixon  and harvards dean mcgeorge bundy  the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator  but rather  as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it   a top scholar in his own right   a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago  last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltechs acting dean of the faculty  dynamic geneticist george wells beadle  57  who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry  time  cover  july 14  1958   it fell to chancellor kimpton  now a standard oil  indiana  executive  to spend his nineyear reign tidying up chicago after the 21year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins  he threw out some of hutchins more wildly experimental courses  raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2100  nearly doubled endowment to 1393 million  but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order  some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era  at caltech  geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the schools famous biology division since 1946  but he has shown a sixthsense ability to spot  recruit and excite able researchers  and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speechmaking  beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters   he avidly reads the wall street journal  and took delight in driving a 250 model a ford for 22 years  then selling it for 300  a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end  but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date  and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away  the man was king leopold 2  of the belgians  who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good  by force  he took under his protection  or stole  900000 square miles of wilderness in central africa  this is an area nearly as large as western europe   and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity  its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings   they were determined by the points at which leopolds explorers and gunmen got tired of walking  the population of the congo is 135 million  divided into at least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects  the religions of the people include christianity  mohammedanism  paganism  ancestor worship and animism  the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate  the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars  to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case   it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done  or failed to do  in the congo since 1885  at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property  but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience  the belgian government itself took over administration  commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism  one definition of paternalism is  the principle or practice  on the part of a government  of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children   the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned  only their judgment  ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time  but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child  if one imagines him to have been born in 1908  was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant  the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo  which is rich in copper  tin  cobalt  manganese  zinc  and uranium  and cotton and palm oil  the colony was administered from brussels  with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote  the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock  in inside africa  john gunther describes one of these  the societe generale  as  the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if  let us say  the house of morgan  anaconda copper  the mutual life insurance company of new york  the pennsylvania railroad  and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together  with the united states government as a heavy partner   had they been truly ruthless  the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion  but they were not  they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes   their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent   they put much effort into public housing  they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food  but instead of delivering the ration  either in actual commodities or in cash  at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month  the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often  would not the children  if they received all their food on the first day of the month  eat it up immediately  and later go hungry   the belgians also placed great emphasis on education  during the 1950s there were as many as 25000 schools in the congo  but almost all the schools were primary  the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of  la chatte  and  le chien  and write his name  some schools were technical  the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land  and trained many  but they did not believe in widespread secondary education  much less in college  it was their conviction that the people should be  brought up together   a grade at a time  until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history  economics and political science  indeed  the belgians discouraged higher education  fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest  when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were  among its 135 million people  exactly 14 university graduates  why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it   in one large oversimplification  it might be said that the belgians felt  far too late  the gale of nationalism sweeping africa  they lacked time to prepare the congo  as the british and french had prepared their colonies  the congolese were clamoring for their independence  even though most were unsure what it meant   and in brussels  street crowds shouted   pas une goutte de sang     not one drop of blood     the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue   rather than teach where teaching was not wanted  they would wash their hands of the mess  it is hard to blame them for this  yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless  as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties  or approximately eight for each university graduate  there were four principal ones  first  there were those congolese  among them joseph kasavubu  who favored splitting the country into small independent states  balkanizing it  second  there were those  moise tshombe  who favored nearbalkanization  a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority  with much power residing in the states  third  there were those  notably patrice lumumba  who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government  and fourth  there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up  however  the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting  a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo  immediately after independence  was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration  they had divided the congo into six provinces  leopoldville  kasai  kivu  katanga  equator and eastern  unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings  thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other  and to them independence meant an opportunity for war  the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable westernstyle form of government  there were to be a president and a premier  and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces  wellwishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations  if internal frictions arose  they could be handled by the 25000man congolese army  the force publique  which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians  the president  joseph kasavubu  seemed an able administrator and the premier  patrice lumumba  a reasonable man  twentyfour hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other  presently the wellarmed members of the force publique  many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes  erupted in mutiny  rioting  raping and looting  terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country  the belgian government decided to act  and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo  on july 11 the head of the mineralrich province of katanga  moise tshombe  announced that his province had seceded from the country  confusion became chaos   each succeeding day brought new acts of violence  lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians  and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them  on july 14 the security council  with france and great britain abstaining  voted the resolution which drew the un into the congo  vague in wording  it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretarygeneral  to take the necessary steps to provide the  congolese  government with such military assistance as may be necessary  until  through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations  the national security forces may be able  in the opinion of the government  to meet fully their tasks   secretarygeneral hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were to come from african  or at least nonwhite  nations  certainly not from the us  russia  great britain or france  he quickly called on ghana  tunisia  morocco  guinea and mali  which dispatched troops within hours  ultimately the un army in the congo reached a top strength of 19000  including about 5000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden  who were the only whites  it took the un three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo  the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed un efforts  the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems  he frequently announced that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with the belgians  and appealed to russia for help   however  there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist  before appealing to the un or to russia  he first appealed to the us for military help  and was rejected   lumumba further complicated the uns mission by initiating small  wars  with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which  under albert kalonji  wanted to secede as well  meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo  sending lumumba equipment for his  wars   dispatching  technicians  and even threatening  on occasion  to intervene openly  but by the end of the threemonth period  in october 1960  something approaching calm settled on the congo  president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him  lumumba fired kasavubu  control of the government  such control as there was and such government as there was  passed into the hands of joseph mobutu  chief of staff of the congolese army  mobutu promptly flung out the russians  who have not since played any significant part on the local scene  although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york  the belgians  at least officially  departed from the congo as well  withdrawing all of their uniformed troops  but they left behind them large numbers of officers  variously called  volunteers  or  mercenaries   who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga  the seceded province which  according to tshombe  holds 65 of the mineral wealth of the entire country  from october 1960 to february 1961  the un forces in the congo took little action  there was no directive for it  the security councils resolution had not mentioned political matters  and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation  whether to unify it  federalize it or balkanize it  during the fivemonth lull  civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo  in february the murder of patrice lumumba  who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe  again stirred the un to action  on feb 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of  all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo  including the use of force  if necessary  in the last resort   although the resolution might have been far more specific  it was considerably tougher than the earlier one  it also urged that the un eject  and prevent the return of  all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers   ordered an investigation of lumumbas death   urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army  the presidency  talking and listening though president john f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloys unexpected report from khrushchev  his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week  high up on the presidents priority list was the thorny question of bizerte  on this issue  the president received a detailed report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson  who had just returned from paris  and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search for a facesaving way  for both paris and tunis  out of the imbroglio  ideally  the president would like the french to agree on a  status quo ante  on bizerte  and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base  to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems  mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend  the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no 2 man in the tunisian government  defense minister bahi ladgham  who flew to washington last week to seek us support  the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable  through ladgham  mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba   and one us official said   the key question now is which side picks up the phone first   on the latin american front  the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the interamerican economic and social council  which the president himself had originally hoped to attend   main purpose of the meeting  to discuss president kennedys alliance for progress  and that was not all  in conferences with nationalist chinas dapper  diminutive vice president chen cheng  mr kennedy assured chiang kaisheks emissary that the us is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations  chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia   however the president  who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow  would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer mongolias admission comes to a vote  the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid  to africa  he sent his most trusted adviser  his brother  attorney general robert kennedy  on a goodwill mission to the ivory coast  all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs   in effect  he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared   we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk  and listen  with reason   crime   skyjacked  from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston  as

one night last week  there was no reason to think it would take any longer  the plane put down on schedule at 135 am in phoenix  thirtyone minutes later  when it took off for el paso  hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teenage boy who had come aboard  at 357 am  with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso  passenger robert berry  a

52yearold veteran 30 years in the air  it was an old story  his plane was being hijacked in midflight again much as it had happened in 1930  when peruvian rebels made him land a ford trimotor at arequipa  but last weeks pirates  like the cubanamerican who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra  newsweek  aug 7   wanted to go to havana  stalling   tell your company there are four of us here with guns   the elder man told rickards  the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message  but  he told the  skyjackers   the 707 didnt carry enough fuel to reach havana   they would have to refuel at el paso  most passengers didnt know what had happened until they got on the ground  jerry mccauley of sacramento  calif  one of some twenty air force recruits on board  awoke from a nap in confusion   the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba   mccauley said   and like a nut i raised my hand  i thought he was the air force recruiter   what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages  along with the crew  they chose four  jack casey  who works for continental airlines in houston   fred mullen from

and submachine guns  other fbi men  talking with the pilot from the tower  conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana  the ground crew  which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes  took fully three hours  still more time was consumed while the pilot  at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six  tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propellerdriven douglas aj  actually  the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane   they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy  who thought at first  as did most others  that it was four followers of cubas fidel castro who had taken over the 707  mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane  kept in touch throughout by telephone  at one time  while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot  the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba  as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains  police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment  from the luggage  they learned that the two air pirates  far from being cubans  were native americans  subsequently identified as leon bearden  50yearold exconvict from coolidge  ariz  and his son  cody  16  a

captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway  several police cars  loaded with armed officers  raced alongside  blazing away at the tires of the big jet  the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines   the plane slowed to a halt  ambulances  baggage trucks  and cars surrounded it  the day wore on  at 1250 pm a ramp was rolled up to the plane  a few minutes later  fbi agent francis crosby  talking fast  eased up the ramp to the plane  unarmed  while crosby distracted the beardens  stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door  so did hostages

more muscle taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation  the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass  85 to 0  the largest peacetime defense budget in us history  with the money all but in hand  however  the administration indicated that  instead of the 225000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested  the armed forces would be increased by only 160000  the  holdback   as pentagon mutterers labeled it  apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and  thus  the new funds spent prudently  in all  the senate signed a check for 467 billion  which not only included the extra 35 billion requested the week before by president kennedy  but tacked on 754 million more than the president had asked for   the senate  on its own  decided to provide additional b52 and other longrange bombers for the strategic air command   the house  which had passed its smaller appropriation before the presidents urgent call for more  was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order  in other areas  congressional action last week included  the senate  by voice vote  and the house  by 224170  passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign  not too unhappily  the senate also voted 52 billion to finance the governments health  welfare  and labor activities  debate on the allimportant foreignaid bill  with its controversial longrange proposals  had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend  white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact  food  stew a la mulligatawny most members of the us senate  because they are human  like to eat as high on the hog as they can  but  because they are politicians  they like to talk as poormouth as the lowliest voter  as a result  ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building  the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food  even while they opposed every move that might improve it  over the years  enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes  the menu has pursued its drab allamerican course  individual senators  with an eye to the voters back home

the insistence of the late sen fred dubois of idaho   made clear to the citizenry that the senates stomach was in the right place  in a daring stroke  the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a 10000peryear frenchborn maitre dhotel  holders of tollroad bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes  longterm trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward  higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues  result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative  things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds  traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing  that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates  as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes  investors who bought tollroad bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments  another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these taxexempt bonds  other taxexempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21  according to standard  poors average  on balance  prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then  however  in the same threemonth period  tollroad bonds  as a group  have bucked this trend  on these bonds  price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines  taxfree returns  investors  however  still see an element of morethanordinary risk in the tollroad bonds  you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page  many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent  or very close to that  and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to  or beyond  the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds  that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds  its not much more  in fact  than the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds  for investors whose income is taxed at high rates  though  a taxfree yield of 4 per cent is high  it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than 16000 of income to be taxed  or for a married couple with more than 32000 of taxed income  swelling traffic  a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12month period  ending in february or march  shows what is happening  the report is based on a survey by blyth  company  investment bankers  nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period  and there is the bright note  the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession  many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter  indication  the longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward  look  for example  at the ohio turnpike  traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february  as compared with those same months in 1960  then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues  after operating costs  as a result  the roads net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds  that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months  that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike  operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961  but up for the 12 months ending in march  costs were held down  despite a bitter winter  for the year  the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs  against 121 per cent in the preceding period  the roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston  slow successes  some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do  the 187mile illinois state toll highway  for example  was not opened over its entire length until december  1958  in the 12 months ended in february  1960  the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load  with the remainder paid out of initial reserves  in the 12 months ended in february  1961  this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest  that improvement is continuing  in the first two months of 1961  earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960  success  for many turnpikes  has come hard  traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates  in these cases  the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases  or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways  many rate increases already have been put into effect  higher tolls are planned for july 1  1961  on the richmondpetersburg  va  turnpike  and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study  easier access  progress is being made  too  in improving motorists access to many turnpikes  the kansas turnpike offers an illustration  net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb 28  1961  further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961  with the opening of a new bypass at wichita  and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city  kans  and kansas city  mo  meanwhile  there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years  for some roads  troubles  investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals  traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike  if nothing is done  the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962  west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months  and  despite recent improvement in revenues  holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same  these  however  are exceptions  the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement  its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full  already  however  several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins  many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point  a top american official  after a look at europes factories  thinks the us is in a  very serious situation  competitively  commerce secretary luther hodges  accompanied by a member of our staff  on may 10 toured plants of two of italys biggest companies  fiat  the auto producer  and olivetti  maker of typewriters and calculating machines  our staff man cabled from turin as follows   follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant  and you learn this   one  modern equipment  much of it supplied under the marshall plan  enables fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day  about half of these are exported   two  wage costs are a fraction of the us costs  a skilled worker on the assembly line  for example  earns 37 a week   three  labor troubles are infrequent  fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years   said secretary hodges   its a tough combination for the us to face   olivetti had a special interest for hodges  olivetti took over underwood  the us typewriter maker  in late 1959  within a year  without reducing wages  underwoods production costs were cut one third  prices were slashed  the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled   the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout  modern machinery  the firm is designconscious  salesconscious  advertisingconscious   hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the us  the inflow of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments   hodges predicted   i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the us  there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas    foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports  the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines  important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these  an international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy  chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting  the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years  point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first  need encouragement to get on their feet  if they have trouble exporting  international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would  idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible  at the same time  another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports  especially dumping of specific products  to highwage textileproducing countries  japan  since 1957  has been  voluntarily  curbing exports of textiles to the us  hong kong  india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the  lancashire pact   none of these countries is happy with these arrangements  the japanese want to increase exports to the us while they have been curbing shipments  they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market  hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain  while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly  the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons  the kennedy hope is that  at the conference or through bilateral talks  the lowwage textileproducing countries in asia and europe will see that  dumping  practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas  gradual  controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what president kennedy wants  this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products  its an important clue to washington thinking  note  too  that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us textile industry   get competitive or get out   in veiled terms  thats what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry  the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines  where modernization doesnt seem feasible  special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed  government research will look into new products and methods  import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved  but the kennedy administration doesnt favor import quotas  rather  they are impressed with the british governments success in forcing  and helping  the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products  whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries  among the highestpaid workers in the world are us coal miners  yet us coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water  steel company of wales  a british steelmaker  wants to bring in virginia coal  cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively  especially in foreign markets  virginia coal  delivered by ship in wales  will be about 280 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines  us coal is cheap  despite high wages  because of widespread mechanization of mines  wide coal seams  attactive rates on ocean freight  many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting  narrow and very deep  productivity of us miners is twice that of the british  welsh coal miners  communistled  are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal  they threaten to strike  the british government will have to decide whether to let us coal in  the british coal industry is unprofitable  has large coal stocks it cant sell  every library borrower  or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fivecent fiction rentals  knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically   im sorry  but we dont have that book  there wouldnt be much demand for it  im afraid   behind this reply  and its many variations  is the everpresent budget problem all libraries must face  from the largest to the smallest  what to buy out of the years grist of nearly 15000 book titles   what to buy for adult and child readers  for lovers of fiction and nonfiction  for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified  when your budget is pitifully small   most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate  a startlingly high percentage do not exceed 500 annually  which includes the librarians salary  and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs  this in the worlds richest city  the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse  confronted with this situation  most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have  or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds  in some parts of the country  however  a cooperative movement has begun to grow  under the wing of state governments  whereby  with the financial help of the state  libraries share their book resources on a countywide or regional basis  new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these cooperative systems  so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow  because it is so large a state  with marked contrasts in population density  the organization of the new york cooperative offers a crosssection of how the plan works  at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state  where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large  sparsely populated area  at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system  in a highdensity area  with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve  both these types  and those in between  are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950  with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state  it was a step in the right direction  but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today  under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts  an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not  as they saw fit  some library boards are wary of the plan  a large  wellstocked library  surrounded in a county by smaller ones  may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great  a small library may cherish its independence and established ways  and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board  within a system  however  the autonomy of each member library is preserved  the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program  facilities  and services  but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system  all services are given without cost to members  so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system  and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day  not too distant  when all the libraries in the state will belong to a coop  to set up a cooperative library system  the law requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus  and the system is organized around it  the collection may be in an existing library  or it may be built up in a central collection  each system develops differently  according to the area it serves  but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency  the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served  and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita  if a library spends a certain number of dollars  in nassau county  for example  the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city  the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons  a figure that has doubled since 1950  this system  by virtue of its variety and size  offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation  the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service  what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge  and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area  the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries  adequate to satisfy everyday needs  could afford  nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters  which will reach its goal of 100000 volumes by 1965  the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building  and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers  basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection  but there is also specialization in science and technology  an indicated weakness in local libraries  on microfilm  headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day  as well as bound volumes of important periodicals  the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans  headquarters gets about 100 requests every day  it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany  which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide  the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries  each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area  which headquarters could then build upon  east meadow has philosophy  psychology  and religion   freeport houses social science  pure science  and language   history  biography  and education are centered in hempstead   levittown has applied science  business  and literature   while hewlettwoodmere is the repository of art  music  and foreign languages  the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant  and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service  this kind of cooperation is not wholly new  of course  public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quartercentury  but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis  local libraries find  too  that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system  and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library  the system passes on these savings to its members  further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing  books are not the only resource of the system  schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary  art  and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs  and to organizations in member communities  the most recent film catalogue  available at each library  lists 110 titles presently in the collection  any of which may be borrowed without charge  this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children  young adults  or adults  although some classics cut across age groups  such as  nanook of the north    the emperors nightingale   and  the red balloon   workshops are conducted by the systems audiovisual consultant for the staffs of member libraries  teaching them the effective use of film as a library service  the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together   consequently an experienced childrens librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote wellplanned library activities  cooperating with the childrens librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences  workshops  and frequent visits  headquarters has also set up a central juvenile bookreview and bookselection center  to provide better methods of purchasing and selection  sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters  where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups  story hours  preschool programs  activities with community agencies  and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the childrens consultant  headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days  threatening to expand beyond its boundaries  in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the childrens program  headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county   it prepares cooperative displays  posters  booklists  brochures  and other promotional material  for use in member libraries   it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used   and it publishes sum and substance  a monthly newsletter  which reports the systems activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries  the system itself is governed by a board of trustees  geographically representing its membership  in nassau  as in other systems  the longrange objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools  and on adult education in general  librarians  a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication  can begin to see results today  library use is multiplying daily  and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans  the teenagers  to them especially the librarians  with the help of coops  hope they will never have to say   im sorry  we dont have that book   today  more than ever before  the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned  the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world  the need for lifetime reading is apparent  education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives  for it is only through knowledge that we  as a nation  can cope with the dangers that threaten our society  the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life  we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read   if we are not discriminating in our reading   if we do not know how to use what we do read  we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age  as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word  a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries  although progress has been made in americas system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america  the problem grows in intensity each year as mans knowledge  and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word  continue to expand  the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition  there are  for example  approximately 25000000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50000000 with inadequate service  in college libraries  57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed last year by the us office of education  and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all  in every aspect of service  to the public  to children in schools  to colleges and universities  the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services  only public understanding and support can provide that service  this is one of the main reasons for national library week  april 1622  and for its theme   for a richer  fuller life  read   \n"
